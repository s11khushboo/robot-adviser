            "This product so far has not disappointed. My children love to use it and I like the ability to monitor control what content they see with ease. great for beginner or experienced person. Bought as a gift and she loves it Inexpensive tablet for him to use and learn on, step up from the NABI. He was thrilled with it, learn how to Skype on it already... I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there. You can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost. This amazon fire 8 inch tablet is the perfect size. I purchased it for my husband so that he has a bigger screen than just his phone. He had gotten me one a few years ago so I knew it would be a good purchase. I gave this as a Christmas gift to my inlaws, husband and uncle. They loved it and how easy they are to use with fantastic features! Great as a device to read books. I like that it links with my borrowed library e-books. Switched from another popular tablet brand and I am happy with the choice I made. It took some time to get books from my previous non-Kindle reader, but finally figured out a way! I love ordering books and reading them with the reader. Excellent product. Easy to use, large screen makes watching movies and reading easier. Simply does everything I need. Thank youAnd silk works wonders Got it as a present and love the size of the screen The kindle is easiest to use, graphics and screen crisp, clear, brilliant colors. Great video quality lots of fun apps fun for the whole family Love love love my kindle fire 8.....this is what my 9 yr old granddaughter said when I bought this for her at Christmas..we have purchased kindled in the past but this one has been the best....love the fact that you can now use a memory card in it...that helps so much when you use it for books...games...music and viedos...thanks Excellent tablet with nice screen. I wish Amazon would pre install the play store, this would have been perfect. Preloaded with the reading app from Kindle but expandable with other apps. Perfect for travel. Carry your library, games and productivity apps in a small footprint. Very happy with this product and easy to use..picture is clear, takes great pictures.. My grandchildren are home schooled and utilize the tables for many learning apps! They LOVE using them as it makes them feel \"so grown up\"! The tablets are a great leaning tool and they are receiving many benefits from them! Great size, easy to carry for traveling. Need to spend more time Looking into apps for contact manegement, interactive calenders and most important, music storage and use. I was surprised when I learned of the capabilities of this device. Now my husband has more access to his desktop and I am doing things which I couldn't on his device. I got it for my son. Its user friendly and durable. The visual quality on the Fire 8 HD is amazing. It runs very fast and is easy to use, very durable. If your looking for a affordable gift this is it!. This is a great tablet for the price, would recommend it to anyone looking for a basic tablet. I am still learning all the things I can do with my new Kindle Fire. It is so much better (lighter in weight and easier to use) than my old tablet. Just the right size for reading books and playing some games. I love everything about this tablet! The imaging is sharp and clear. It's fast and light weight. Love it! My children love this table great quality of pictures, excellent camera I bought 3 tablets and my family was not disappointed. Great tablet fast screen good size never gives me problem This is exactly what the person wanted as a gift and she enjoys using it. It's fast and easy to use. This is my second kindle fire . For the money you cannot beat this tablet. Full of features, picture quality is great, and very fast speed while using the internet. Easy to use, solid build, sharp HP screen for movies. Who needs more? Tablet is perfect for beginners who just want basic this is my first tablet .. love it .. actually read my first e-book on it .. large screen, easy to read & play games .. fits nicely in my purse Sleek packaging easy set up and great for anyone who wants a e reader with more to offer. Best and most affordable option of all the Kindle devices available. I did not want to get a new kindle but my old one would not charge or show a charge anymore. I could not depend on it for any length of time so I finally broke down and bought a new one. I am very happy with this one. I was afraid I would lose my music and photos since not all came from the Amazon store. However, everything I had on the old kindle transferred to the new one. I am still learning all about it but so far so good. My daughter likes this tablet to play her online games! Excellent tablet to leave at my easel and display reference photos. It's light enough to velcro to a articulating stand (so I can position the tablet right next to my canvas). It's cheap enough to not worry about. I love it, for the price. I bought this wanting for books comics and movies and it has not disappoint ever since My 4 year old Grandson loves his Kindle. He had to have one after his sister got one. Easy to use. As a beginner I found this pad very good. Enjoy the kindle app. Purchased this for my daughter to do more reading. It has so much more options for her if she wants. this is a great tablet for the price. my kid loves it ,does alot reading on it. Great tablet for the price. It is easy to navigate. I believe that this will be very useful during my husbands recovery from foot surgery. This is a wonderful device. I love the extra capabilities and apps. I am very happy with this tablet. The worst thing is that my steals it all the time. Lol A family member has vision problems. They had seen/used the Kindle of another family member - especially the ability to scale text. This device will make it possible to read, which she has had extreme difficulty doing. Easy setup and connect to WIFI. Great viewing area. Easy to read in bright places. I got this fire for my friend who wants to buy kindle..this serves both Kindle and Tab... very nice and very cheap..worth for what i paid.. I highly recommend this for beginners Really enjoyed the price value of this tablet versus ipad Amazing tablet with fast processor. It looks great... got good deal We got this for our 5 year old and this is really great for the price. Works like a charm!! I find it easy to use, but the kindle does not come with instructions, so you have to find your way around. I love this tablet. The battery life last a long time. I use my Amazon Kindle Fire predominately for watching movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix's, and checking my emails. I also carry it to my appointments and meetings. It is a compact tablet, and not big and bulky. The playback of the movies are great, and the movies are HD. Great little tablet if you are looking for something to watch movies and checking emails. I would definitely recommend this tablet to friends and family members. My daughter loves this kindle, she does so much with it,well worth the money. Was looking for a tablet that was highly portable & could run my DIRECTTV app & stream videos. (Other electronics I have are much older versions). Salesman recommended this model to me based on personal experience. I am still learning all its functions but so far it seems easy to use & is doing what it promised to do. This is my second Fire, the other one is now retired. I like having HD. Works just fine. My wife bought this for me for my birthday. I enjoy reading biographys which usually have color photos. The regular Kindle make the pics black and white or they're aren't any. This allows me to see the color photos. I also love the night feature when I'm in bed reading. I no longer need a light on to read or need to hold a large book. Thanks to a knowledgeable, low-pressure salesperson, I was ready to buy my first tablet. This one was the right price (on sale) and I have not been disappointed. Every few days I learn more ways to use it besides checking e-mails & checking out library books & audio books. It stays charged for days, even with regular use. I recommend it as an inexpensive and very satisfactory alternative to more expensive tablets. It's a great tablet for the price. Don't expect it to be as fast more expensive ones. It's meant for casual use and it does a great job at that. For the price, you can't beat it. Get a nice large microsd card and you don't have to worry about space. It runs a little slow on certain things if you are multitasking but it's a simple tablet. I've run plenty of 720p videos without fail. It's great for ebooks or other files. Some more elaborate pdfs take a while to load if they have a lol of graphics. Battery life seems good for a small table too.The only real Issue I have is the Amazon App store being limited. It is an offshoot of Android but not all the same apps are available. There is a way around it but I wish they would just allow it access to Google Play or at least offer the same apps.So, it's a nice inexpensive table that works great. For the money, you will love it but don't get upset that is doesn't run as fast as a $500 tablet. That's not its job. Very easy to use tablet. Lots of apps and game available. We love the FreeTime settings for kids on the newer Kindle Fires. I was able to create a login for each of our kids as well as myself and set limits to the amount of device time they are allowed daily (can set to more for weekends if desired). You can set the age restrictions for content also, to avoid inappropriate ads, etc. Once you've downloaded apps, you can choose which ones you want each child to have access to in their profile settings, so if one child is older you can allow them access to something their younger siblings shouldn't have. Basically, I like that I can set their access rights and know they're safe so I don't have to continually monitor every moment. By the way, FreeTime kids settings are available without having to subscribe to their FreeTime app access plan. :) Great tablet, very clear picture. Would buy again. Purchased as a door prize gift given with a one year Amazon membership. The recipient loves it and says it performs very well. (As a past Amazon Fire user, now i-Pad graduate, I loved my Amazon Fire for more than 4 years without any problems. In fact, I just recycled it on to my son and it runs like a champ). I have 4 other kinds of tables. This the best I have had. I can listen to music, read a book, listen to a book, or watch movies/tv shows. Great product for the kids gaming apps parental controls to make sure you can monitor kids and prevent unwanted app purchases I purchased 2 of these tablets for my 6 and 8 year old. They were a Black Friday special for $59. They are perfect for the apps and games they wanted. Great product. Love the Amazon ecosystem. The Freetime subscription is a must Needed something a bit larger than the 6+ to stream Netflix, this was perfect! my husband bought this for me as a Christmas present. I couldn't understand why he bought it because I already have a Kindle Fire.Once I opened it and got it going, I loved all it could do plus the graphic is so much colorful than my older Kindle. my grandson-8-loves this --the games and the books! Easy to use, responds quickly, great screen brightness. Works as we thought it should. NO PROBLEMS. Good buying experience. I am a prime member & I love this tablet. Very user friendly especially if you are a prime member with amazon. Not real tech savvy so I need all the help I can get to keep things simple & automatic. Great clarity of picture/data. Have a 10\" tablet and wasn't sure about downgrading size (old eyes) but was delighted to see it works fine at 8\" instead of 10\". Also, easier to take around in the smaller size. Highly recommend especially if you subscribe to Amazon and are a prime member. Great benefits!! Got this for my wife. She loves the bigger screen and the better app management features that this one has over her earlier generation kindle. Definitely worth it! Connects to home WiFi automatically. Many books, and many games. Actually functions like a computer tablet. E-mail is a breeze. Bought this to replace no-name budget tablet for my daughter. She loves this as it is much faster and has a better display than her old tablet. This is a wonderful value as it is faster, has a better display and sound, is a name brand and cost about the same ... what's not to love about this product? She loves this tablet. It works well unlike her \"bargain\" tablet which she tried to use previously and cost about the same. She likes the sound of it also! She enjoys the free games she downloaded and navigates the wev easily with it. I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. It's speedy when loading books! Daughter got this as a present. It was easy to set up and display is great. Features allow us to limit her time on games, web, etc. while allowing her unlimited time to read I have enjoyed just learning how to use it. You're never too old to learn new things. bought for husband and he was surprised it does the work he needs it for This was a birthday present and it was ideal for a traveler to read ebooks on while on the rood My teenage daughter enjoyed her three year old 7\" Kindle for recreation but wanted a larger screen for word processing. Paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard and she was thrilled. The People I purchased this for during Christmas Holiday LOVED IT... I purchased two of these for my kids, ages 12 and 10. Forget the IPod touch. For the price, this tablet can't be beat! They can download games, books and movies for free all included with my Amazon Prime membership. Awesome!! my kids enjoy the Fire HD and they love the picture quality Really like the updates this product has in comparison to my first one Functionality and ease of use are outstanding right out of the the box. Super clear screen and weight is minimum and is a joy to use. This tablet is great for kids and adults who have little to no knowledge of computers. It handles easily and has plenty of storage My god sister has been using these for years.What to read more! The latest Amazon 8\" HD tablet is a very good tablet for the price. The updated processor and extra memory (with expansion slot) allow for very good performance on all that we use this tablet for. Netflix, Hulu, browsing the internet, and doing e-mails all work very smoothly. Would recommend to anyone looking for a very cost effective tablet totally worth the money, has all the apps I use on a daily basis! Good tablet. Wife loves it and would recommend.... I use mine mainly for its bigger screen. I do all the same things i do on my phone..but love the big screen. I bought one for eaxh of my nieces too. And they both love theres. Making videos..playing music..reading books. They bith love them! Im happy i got them for all of us. And always reccomend them to my friends for their kids too. Amazon Fire HD8 is a great product for the price. I picked it up for $69 during the holiday shopping season. Replacing a 1st gen Samsung Tab 2. This thing is sooo much faster. Perfect size for reading Kindle books , emails, and doing the social media thing. My kids can play, read, watch movies and much more love it!!! I love this Kindle!! I am biased I think however I have had 3 previous ones I prefer Kindles to any other tablet This Tablet was purchased for our Grandmother so she could play games and read books on. Bought a few of these for Christmas gifts .Everyone is happy !Its a great device for the $$. Low price, and great quality as always from FIRE devices. Bought this for our year end holiday party raffle prize pool. Great price and people always have a use for an amazon tablet. Came with Kaspersky for free as well, which is a pretty generous complimentary add on. Has many educational apps I would definitely go into the settings if you're a mother like me who Is a very strict of what your children watch on TV or what games and apps they download I would definitely recommend setting the parental controls before giving it to them. In my personal opinion as a mother I feel it helps by setting the restrictions/content on It helps keep their mind away from the gutter Bcuz most apps and Internet websites have inappropriate sites children should not be watching. We can't control what they put on the Internet but we can control what our children watch and download they stay very occupied on educational apps ,read books most of these apps are free to I also recommend NOT putting a payment method option other than that my kids loved it Very nice for light internet browsing, keeping on top of email, viewing videos, and reading e books, which I like to get free from the library. Good browser, good battery power, fast charge. Very relaxing to sit in a comfy chair and read or browse. Has given me hours of enjoyment and information for a minimal price. I bought this for my wife to replace her old Kindle and she loves it. Much easier to read than an iPad and updated features make it a great purchase. Great tablet and price. Ordering online easy. Not happy took so long to receive though. Best tablet, good price, nice looking. Ordering on line was easy. I got this for my mom for Christmas. Every time I visit, she shows me something else she can do with it. I'm so jealous, I hope I get one. This is my fourth Kindle...upgrading each time. Mine goes everywhere with me and is used throughout the day. Wouldn't be without it. We bought this for our son when he went to college. He is able to upload all of his books and other documents. I purchased it for my mother-in-law and she loves it it was easier for her to use and understand The Amazon Fire is amazing! Picture clarity and sound are excellent! I highly recommend this tablet! Love it! Sharp picture and easy to use. And a fantastic price This a great tablet for everyone. Plenty of memory for downloading. Great features all around. I own two Nook tablets, another Kindle and a Samsung and this is the best one yet. Excellent battery life. Lets me check emails the Web and with Kindle. books can be switched from reads to listens. Also works better than the Nook with audiobooks. This is a step up from what my son was using. He said it does well and easy to use. I bought this for my 6 year old and it's perfect. Faster & clearer than older versions. Awesome good size large enough for games and photos Great gift easy to use and she loves being able to take it anywhere I bought this to replace the 7 inch version I lost in the airport. I wanted the bigger screen and the higher resolutions. It is much when loading games in offline mode as well as videos I have downloaded from Amazon Prime to play on the plane when wifi is not available. That was a plus for me. And now that the updated Netflix app allows the same thing, I have plenty of videos. I can also play my .mp4 videos using VLC player that I load to a microSD card. Of course you have wifi and Bluetooth so great for surfing try he net or listening to music. The 8 in screen is perfect for lying in bed and watching my show. I highly recommend this. Intuitive user interface, rapid online access through well designed features, light weight, ergonomic buttons for volume and power. Overall a thoroughly well designed, excellent priced device for web browsing and social media. great device for the price. good looking screen, quick and efficient. amazon app store isn't that bad either Great gift for any age. Wish I bought two. I can do everything on this that I was doing on my ipad I got 2 of these for my 8 yr old twins. My 11 yr old has one but this one is better. Perfect way to get them to read This is a superb tablet for the price. It doesn't come with the Android operating system. It has Amazon's operating system. The battery last a good long time and apps run very fast. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a tablet. My daughter love her new tablet, I use for a few days and it's pretty good So very happy with the new kindle ! I highly recommend this product ! It may be cheap but this is a great tablet and works awesome. My wife absolutely loves this tablet. It wad an early Christmas present Bought for my 11 year old son and he absolutely loves it. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son. Very easy to use. I am an Amazon Fan. Ive only had Amazon tablets so I cant compare them with any other brand. But, Amazon has great customer service, a lot of great apps. The HD 8 is a great tablet for watching movies, most games, and social media. Its not as good as the Kindle fire hdx. The speakers arent as good, the hdx has more of a surround sound, but the hd 8 is less expensive, has a place for a sims card for extra space, and has an ok front and rear facing camera. Overall its a great tablet for a great price. I previously had bought an older model of these tablets for my children. I wasn't to happy with them. But this tablet is great, it has child safety features like wether you would like to have them surf the web to even limiting the amount of hours your child can use it. Very good tablet for what my kids will use it for which is mostly Netflix Hulu and even though there isn't you tube app there are alternate apps that acces you tube. Got this tablet for Black Friday. Wow, 16 gigs, great screen, expandable memory, what a deal. Tablet is a must have for Amazon Prime members. It unlocks the door for all those great Prime perks; books, shows, and shopping. Pairs to Alexa. Great screen for books! Buy it already! I love the size and portability of this. Keeps me in touch and having fun. Nice tablet and couldn't beat the Black Friday price I'm sorry I didn't buy it sooner! Very easy to use. Love it. It feels a bit more rugged than my original Fire tablet, and I believe it is an excellent value. For a cheaper price this does more than my kindle- love having this tablet Had a smaller version. Love the bigger screen. Use this product more than a computer. I bought 2 of the kindles for my grandsons. They love them! Had them charged and set up right away. No issues at this point. Santa dropped this off for our 4th grader along with expanded memory. he uses it for Netflix and Youtube as well as Minecraft and other Apps. Why spend hundreds on something for basic kids needs? I'm sure this will last him a few years and is well worth the price. Got this tablet for my 3 year old son and he can not put it down. It is so much to do. So many learning games. I love this product This is a good device for entertainment and entry level tasks. I think it can do a lot for the price. Nice price for the new model with Alexa built in and expandable storage! Great gift for my dad. Clear picture and easy set up Love my kindle! Works better than expected! Kindle is much faster than my old tablet! I have never owned a tablet. Wanted an I-Pad like most, but couldn't afford the sticker price. This one fit my needs perfect. I mainly just use it for web surfing and streaming video. No complaints so far! I would recommend this device. also great for listening to music and also for movies The screen picture is crisp and bright. I will use this tablet for many things. small and powerful... great adult toy for a reader This was purchased as a Christmas present for my aunt who lives with us. For the price, I thought it would be a good option for her since she doesn't want to drop the cash on an iPad.For comparison, the closest thing I have is an 8\" insignia tablet with similar screen resolution, storage, and features that was released at the same time. The Fire tablet impresses me! It is more responsive than the existing android tablet I have.This tablet runs FireOS which is Amazon's customized version of Android. Typically I do not like custom Android, preferring to have as close to a vanilla system as possible. I am not bothered by that with the Fire. If you need them the parental controls are second to none! The Amazon app store is extensive, although not as extensive as the Google Play store. Still you should be able to find pretty much everything you need there.This is not a flagship device, but performs incredibly for the price. I will most likely be purchasing one soon for myself. Great tablet for reading and also surfacing the web, along with your favorite social media apps! A Great value for the money you can save instead of a Ipad from Apple. Great for reading - nice image, easy on the eyes and lightweight. Bought this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas! She LOVES it!!! A great alternative to a pricey iPad Mini!!! She uses it for watching Netflix, YouTube and we use it for homeschool. We are very happy with our purchase!!! I got this tablet on sale for my wife and she loves it We love Kindle Fire, we purchase it for an older couple and it's easy to work. The Amazon Fire is a great tablet with awesome graphics.

She enjoys that it's easy to use and has good picture and sound quality. The price was also great The Amazon fire is simply amazing I would not buy anything else. We bought this for our three daughters! Got a kid proof case and added free time for a low monthly fee and couldn't be happier! So much better than worrying about them breaking my phone or iPad! I love my Kindle. I won't be without one. I've even bought an extra one, just in case. I believe it's the best tablet on the market. Could not have asked for a better tablet for the money. I wasn't looking for anything extreme. Just wanted it to look nice and do it's job for games and browsing. Well it does that and more. Gave it to our son for Christmas and now I want one myself. We are going to buy another for my mother in law. Lightweight, simple layout. Snappy. Can't go wrong. It was a perfect gift for my godson. He loved it! Definitely would recommend this product.

This was a request from our 7 yr old granddaugter who had always asked her older sister if she could share hers due to we bought this same tablet/size a few yrs earlier. Loved the security/parental control options.Starfall a favorite educational app were told is a must have. Really enjoy Pics/Viber due to their in a different state. Also some games on a time limit. Size and resolution are perfect. I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister and she LOVES it. It's easy to use, lightweight and doesn't seem to have a lot of bugs or glitches. It's a good source of entertainment for when she's at work but has down-time. She passes the time reading ebooks, browsing the web and playing games. I originally purchased a Kindle paperwhite but returned it the next day and purchased this one. Very easy to read on, watch movies, and listen to music. Perfect tablet to take anywhere you go and lighter than my IPad. Easy to use tablet for every day use. Additional apps can help increase productivity for work and daily use. This tablet does all I need a tablet to do. Reason why it's my 3rd one. Bought this tablet for my fiancée daughter, after getting it home and set up, I decided to keep it for myself. Great screen and works great with my pair of Amazon echos. I love it and highly recommend it. This is my first Amazon e-reader-tablet and the second e-reader I have. It is easy to use once you get through the initial hoops. I like the free games and the fact that I new can load books from my computer to the tablet. And one thing, I am not in the market for a tablet but for a bigger e-reader. It is a lot better than the Nook that I have. I love this product I have Bought several versions of this tablet for my kids over the years and have been ever impressed with it. I first got one for my son, the my oldest daughter to replace her children's tablet, which was worthless, this tablet gives you everything you could want and allows you to control what your kids access on it and even lets you see what they download onto it. if you want to set a time when it shuts off at night you can, when they can play games or use Netflixs you can...great product!

Comes with bunch of preloaded Amazon apps. This tablet is great. I loved the color and all the features it has. I will be buying more for my daughters. Great purchase It's a excellent tablet for my kid she downloaded games and watch cartoons I was looking for a Good tablet under $100..this delivered..getting used to Amazon apps LOL Excellent ratio quality price.

Works well and the battery life is great. Size is nice too. Big enough for 1 hand if needed. This is a great tablet for books, games and web browsing. It is very user friendly, -and I would definitely recommend this product! I enjoy to use the reader and like the idea that I can go to the internet from the Kindle.

I also love the option to restrict apps and content for her age! I bought two of these Amazon Fire HD tablets in December as Christmas gifts. Both recipients are happy with these as gifts. I plan to purchase one in the near future for myself. Biting as a gift, my only concern was the size and the Amazon interface. It was easy enough to download the Google play store, so it was familiar to the user. Size was an initial concern, but it was just right to watch movies without being so cumbersome. My son really likes the larger screen to play games. Very easy to use and has so much to offer for the low price. great product, easy to use, love the lighted pad, ease of down loading books, They were using them on Christmas morning!! It didn't take them long too be getting the best from those tablets i love it amazon is nice read book on it play games on it I bought this Kindle as a gift for my mother so she could access her Facebook account easily. She loves the ease of using it. I have 3 kindle tablets in my home and they are used daily. My mother uses hers for email and some light gaming and for watching Netflix as well. Very satisfied. I wanted a low cost internet device to feed internet radio choices into my stereo. This fit the bill well. I use the headphone jack to connect with my stereo and get great sound. I don't use most of the other apps that come on the device. The Kindle Fire is a wonderful, small device to use for a multitude of tasks. We use it mostly as an ereader and has been so simple to use. So happy we chose this one. It is lightweight and convenient to take with you. I bought this as a temporary replacement for my wife's 11\" Kindle Fire HD that was out for service. She liked this 8\" model so much that she continued using it after the 11\" one returned. So easy to download and then read. Enjoy reading that I can take anywhere without the heaviness of a book I bought this after subscribing to an Amazon Prime membership. This is a great little tablet at such a low price.. too good of a deal to pass up when it was on sale. It has the ability to talk to Alexa, surf the web, listen to music and read books/magazines (lots of free music and books for Prime members). This is my second Fire, I'm upgrading from the 2nd generation 7\" model. Love the screen resolution. Movies and videos are sharp and no pixelating. The camera is a bonus my first version did not have. All together this was a great buy for under $100 on sale. Thank you Best Buy. This tablet has it all. Amazon offers tons of free apps, hundreds of thousands of free e-books and tons of free games. The tablet is intuitive and intelligent. I seamlessly enjoy streaming my favorite shows and reading articles, books and periodicals. What I love most is that the tablet doesn't place all apps on the device, but uses the users miro SD card instead for up to 200GB of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games, apps, books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. It also allows the owner to share the device with family members, delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. There is even an option to create children's accounts--extra bonus. I am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto my Samsung Smart television. I will definitely consider Amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. It maintains a charge for a good deal of time, alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. I can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day, sometimes two days. No one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the owner/end-user. I love to read and this tablet makes it so easy to carry an entire library with me everywhere. I have also become addicted to the free underground games. Bought this 8\" model to use in addition to my current 3 year old Kindle Fire HD (7 inch model). So far I am very pleased with the quality of this unit. The slightly larger screen makes watching movies much better. I didn't want the larger 10\" screen (yet). I purchased this on Black Friday because I could pass on the price. The tablet works great for basic internet needs and great for shopping on Amazon. If I were to purchase another Android Tablet, I will look for something with a little more power since this tablet slows when multi-tasking. I bought this for my son (he's 1.5 years old) so he could play basic toddler games, but I found the tablet to be extremely useful for school with it's large screen and super long battery life. I'm waiting for the Surface Pro 5 but this tablet that I got for so cheap is making me second guess paying so much! For basic lecture taking notes and watching Netflix or Hulu and kid games, this can't be beat. The best tablet for the price i use it everyday to watch youtube videos Great purchase for my granddaughter for Christmas. This tablet is perfect for just about anything you could want to do on a tablet. Great item at great price, MY WIFE LOVES IT AND WONT PUT IT DOWN! great black friday deal for a mediocre tablet. android os though! Wanted a tablet at a cheap price and this item fit the bill. Bought on Black Friday which made the price even better. The screen looks good and the performance for the apps I have used so far have met expectations. I mainly used for surfing the web, youtube, and netflix. This device handles each with ease. Overall, I am satisfied with this device. Works well; no issues with reboots or system hangs.. Good size - not too big and not too small. Screen is good for reading. Battery life is good, I've bought a few books from Amazon but mostly side-loaded books from the library onto a 32 GB micro sd card. I got this for my son and he loves it! He can play games, watch movies, you tube videos, and use the internet for help with homework. He also loves all the books, and aps. Was a great black Friday deal should have gotten one for myself. I purchased this product for my youngest son! He loved the color and the size. The storage is great for the number of activities that he has downloaded! Was looking for a tablet to run my remote music server with from my easy chair. My first tablet I bought at about the same price ran through the battery in an hour. Amazon product is much better for battery life and image quality is very nice. This product is easy to use. Screen size is great. Would recommend to anyone. I got it for my kid and she loves it. The amazon free time and prime well worth the money Best tablet around, cheaper than most and does just as much as other tablets. Great buy, it works perfect! Battery lasts a few days too. She likes to read books and this is a fast and cheap way for her to do so It's a great buy. Just to read emails and go on the web Great Christmas gifts for the kids. Hours of fun and games. I purchased this tablet mostly for entertainment. I enjoy playing games and this tablet is great for that purpose. Also plan on using it for reading electronic books. Very nice quality product. East to set up and use. So much more screen size than previously kindles. Fast charging. Longer battery life. Purchased for my mom to read ebooks, great performance, screen looks good, easy to use. Very happy with this purchase. less expensive than last year with so many more features and bigger screen! Bought for my wife for X-mas and she loves it. Hasn't put it down This was a reasonable replacement for a broken tablet. Better and faster than Kindle 7\". Great performance for the price. Love it, easy to operate. Very reasonable price - on sale. You can do some many things and the best part apps for free on Amazon underground! Works great for my 6 year old. Wanted an inexpensive tablet for himsince he can be pretty rough with things. So far so good, and we love the FreeTime app. Bought 2 for each of our teenagers and they just love it... Very cool reading features and zero buffering while watching Netflix. My mother, husband, and daughter all enjoy using Fire. It's a great way to stay preoccupied. Out of all the tablet choices out there we buy these for our children over any other. You can't beat the price and durability. very good product and right on the cost! Great gift for the holidays. Great for reading, game playing, searching the web and social media. I really like the Fire IS 8 16gb, it is fast and smooth. This is so easy to use and does exactly what I hoped. Great tablet for streaming ! good internet connection along with a nice display Bought it as an e-reader. Convenient and easy to use. Text is very readable. I am pleased. So cool after playing with this for a while now I would never spend the money on an apple for what I am doing with it. Love the new fire hd 8. Price is amazing and if you are an amazon prime mbr its even better! Great for the kids as you can lock their profiles to a kids mode and they can't buy anything. If i had one downfall its the smaller amount of apps available than apple or google play. Had the Fire HD 7\" before and just wanted to upgrade. Loving it so far and really enjoying the bigger screen! The tablet is not for me it is for a Christmas gift This was a great buy for my son. He needed something that he could easily transport and that woudl allow him to access the internet and various forms of media. This was a perfect choice since he also has a amazon Prime account. This was replacement for my wife's original iPad and broken Kindle Paperwhite. She loves it, as it does basically everything both of the previous devices did in one unit that is easy to use, has good battery life, very nice screen resolution and good size for her. Great value, especially compared to an iPad. for the price this is a great works well the for the price display is hd love it for the money, you will be well pleased, I think it is a big bargain ! I purchased this tablet for my mother, but I set it up and tested it out. It is super fast! I have the original Kindle Fire and all I can say is Amazon has come a long way! The new Fire HD8 is so much better than the original! I like it so much that I am thinking of purchasing one for myself! I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone! Very happy with this purchase, it was exactly what I was looking for My original Kindle Fire no longer accepted a charge. I wasn't going to replace it, because I bought an iPad. When I saw the HD8 in a kiosk in a BB store, I realized how much better I liked the size and feel of it for reading books (the iPad is preferred for other things). This Fire's clarity is much improved over my old one, plus it responds better. I don't like that I can't choose a photo for the locked screen - that it HAS to be an advertisement. I also don't like that it usually takes a few trys to unlock. Menial issues from my perspective. This is my third Kindle, I still have the other two; however, this has a camera and much larger screen. I would take this product any day over a tablet. My wife and kids love easy to use and the size is perfect Great tablet for beginners! Very light and screen is wide. Enjoy using for travels. Got this for my grandmother and she absolutely loves it. This is just the right size and can put games on it just like an iPad. The Kindle is a great way to read and watch videos with ease! great size,sound and battery. just buy it already. I've had my other Kindle Fire for 5-6 years. It's still working but slowing down. I bought the updated version while it was on sale. I love it! I play games on it, download books, check my email and facebook. It's like a portable mini computer and I wouldn't be without it. I like it better than other people's tablets and you can't beat the price. I bought some for gifts and everybody loves it! I'd recommend it to people of all ages. Great product, no complaints at all,good for kids and adults Bought a Fire HD 8 tablet for my wife. She doesn't like using computers and avoids smartphones, but her new tablet is a big hit. She uses it to play games and to stream movies and radio programs. I use it for everything else -- reading news, checking e-mail, online shopping, etc. It was very easy to set up and even easier to use. Plenty of speed and capacity to do everything we want. We already own kindles so we know they are great ! My son is going to live this! I purchased 2 of these FIre HD tablets as gifts. They pack a lot of punch for the price. I helped set them up so I was able to get an idea of how they are going to work. The screen was very nice and clear. Speed of tablet was good. It is easy to use. If you are already in the Amazon family through prime it is a no-brainer.I don't believe you can get a better tablet at this price point. I bought these as a starter online browser. It is a very portable pad . Great price. Just what my wife wanted and needed she loved it! It is easy to use and simple to set up! Good tablet for the money. A good add on if you have Amazon prime We bought it for our 9 yr. Old daughter and she loves it. We do as well. Kindle tablets are great! its fast, it has good lighting. its got the 16gb space, best gift ive bought for a bookreader. With a $20 off deal last blackfriday, who will not get it. Much clearer and faster than the other fire HD. Light weight too This is my 2nd Fire tablet. I will alwyas need one. Just wish they lasted longer than 4 years. While there are some apps that are missing due to not using the Google Play Store the list is minimal. The tablet itself is quick, responsive, and noticeable nicer than the 7\" fire. Picked this up when it was on sale for black friday sales. It's great for in front of the TV and catching up on email and light web browsing. Price was fabulous for an entry level tablet. Right on Was impressed how quick and responsive touch and overall speed.Including Alex app.fit in top coat pocket I have been buying Kindles since they first came out. When ever I want to upgrade Kindle is my chosen brand. I am not very tech savvy and I enjoy watching movies, listening to music and primarily reading. I like the ability to purchase narration for my favorite titles and using text-to-speech for the rest. Wife loves this thing. She reads nonstop on it. She can't put it down This is a really good tablet for adults but especially great for kids as you can load movies or add apps that they can use. The cost is so low you just can't beat it. Plus, the main feature for me was the Amazon Kindle name on the product which puts it way ahead of the no name tablets on the market. Great product and gift. I purchased two of these on Black Friday. What a great purchase. These are very inexpensive and have the ability to do so many things for the kids. I later bought tough cases to keep any damage minimal. this tablet has the best battery ive ever seen. The picture is great too. LIke that there are lots of apps to choose from. Very user friendly I bought this for my wife because she plays a lot of games along with my grandson, this is perfect to download all the games they want without taking up space on her iPad. Great to take with me when I need alone time to just surf and read. Awesome tablet! Love using it to read and surf the web. Enjoy having the kindle. My son uses all the time for reading. It has helped him improve in his reading skills. We are glad we bought it. Thank you. This was one of the best birthday presents, I ever purchased for my husband. He said he doesn't use the computer, but he was on my smartphone daily viewing FB. I got him a drone for Christmas and he needed something to view, while it is flying. I researched the Kindle Fire and thought he could practice with it until spring. He farms, so isn't busy in the winter. Thank goodness, because he is busy with his Kindle for hours every day. He thinks it is great and I do too, because now I have my phone back. I really enjoy reading. So much so I was running out of shelf space. I have read a few books with my I-pad mini but it really didn't do the trick. No so with my new Amazon Fire Hd-8. Handy sized, not the least bit heavy and super bright. Add in the face that digital material from magazines to novels are often as not far cheaper that \"hard copies\". Amazing video quality easy to maneuver wonderful screen size easy set up The Fire HD8 strikes an excellent balance between performance and price. It has many of the features you'd want in a tablet for a fraction of the cost. Works flawlessly for reading and video streaming. This is my second Kindle and I love it. It's lightweight, simple, and fast. It's convenient for trips and fits in my bag without weighing it down. Bought this as a gift. My mother likes it. It's easy and simple to use. I am loving my fire tablet and I am using it everyday at home and at work on break Very little set up, Amazon helpful in setting up the functions. Clear pictures and easy to use. Take pictures both ways Bought this for my mom and it was just what she needed and at a great price. Been wanting to get an Ipad for myself, but think this might be a great less expensive option for me as well. Perfect thing I needed to read books on and play my games I'm loving the tablet so far. I really like the Amazon underground, and the Fire OS just updated, so it has Alexa on it now. :) this tablet is perfect for surfing the internet and following social media For its price. Amongst the others I felt this was a deal Perfect size and very responsive. I have 4 of them. No issues runs games and internet well. ,,,,,,,,,,,, Smartphone works on the job for me, but with the Fire I can read instructions and worksheets. It is a useful tool for connecting with both friends and colleagues. 8-inches is the right size for holding in hand and carrying with you. Gives me the information, beats printing everything out, or carrying around a large laptop. Think this will be a great product for my parents it is a Christmas gift. The Amazon fire tablet is an excellent product. I primarily use it to purchase and read books from Kindle. Also, I use it for my Facebook activity. The battery life is long and it recharges quickly. My 10 year old son also enjoys using it. I would highly recommend this product to others. My husband is a truck driver and being on the road away from home, he likes to have shows and movies to watch. This has so much space for him to download things to watch. I have had several budget tablet, but this blows them all away. You have to be willing to be invested in the Amazon ecosystem, but it is well worth it. Bought for daughter, love the parental control and curfew setting I like the portability of it. I take it with me when I babysit my granddaughter. Had the previous version of this tablet and was looking to upgrade. Got this on sale and am very pleased. My daughter love this tablet! Easy to use and carry The best kindle fire ever, love how quickly the apps run, being able to watch movies, listen to music, etc. on it The salesman was very good pointed us in the right direction. The tablets are perfect for our triplet grandsons. Excellent value for the price. Super easy to use and set up. Wonderful display. I love the fact that you can add an sd card for more memory unlike the old Kindles. Plus I'm really impressed with the fact the Amazon has such great offers. I love my kindle. It fast, great pict quality and is so convenient to use. I love using it to watch Netflix. It worth the purchase if you don't want to spend so much money. I love this tablet!! Excellent quality speakers and screen. Lots of storage space. Worth the money!! Bought it for my husband and he loves it. This is perfect for what he wanted it for. Very fast and super easy to use I'm very pleased with this purchase!! It's works really well and don't have any issues at all The Kindle Fire has great features for the price. The video quality is asstounding. If you want a tablet to use on a daily basis for facebook or do online purchases you couldn't ask for a better tablet. I use to read books, watch movies, and get online.. it works great and easy to use. Throughly enjoying my fire tablet. Can play games and read books. Am very pleased with it. Excellent screen , fast response. Almost a steal for that price. Kindle Fire is a dream. Larger screen easy to read I HAVE BEEN WITH AMAZON PRIME FOR 2 YEARS AND THIS NEW FIRE HD MAKES IT WORTH IT. i WATCH MOVIES WHEN I FLY BECAUSE I CAN DOWNLOAD THEM. THE BATTERY LAST FOR DAYS. I USE IT EVERYDAY NOW. Reading is easy, can make font as large as you need Not to much to complain about. for less than 100 dollars you get an 8in tablet that has pretty good specs; expandable storage, long battery life, great speakers, fast processor, decent cameras and hi def screen. easy to use and well built tablet....The only knock is the included adds but, after using it for awhile you barely notice it. This is the fastest booting tablet I have come across. The speed at which I can access sites is really amazing. I went into bestbuy to purchase a replacement after mine died. I loved my kindle, and decided to get 2-in-1 with the fire. It is perfect for my needs. great product at a great price.i like the builtin filter which is easy on youreyes.probably the best reader under 100 dollars. Very good product. Super quality and the Best Buy store rep explained me about the product This is my third Kindle Fire and it improves each time. Colors are crisper and best of all it stays charged a lot longer. I bought this for my sister, who already had the Kindle 7. For the price the 8 is better. First the obvious. a inch more screen does make a difference and the HD makes reading and streaming alot clearer. Being able to add more storage with a micro SD card is a huge plus as well. This device includes a camera! And last at under 100.00 makes this a huge value for a great tablet. Excellent. Just as good as iPad with a fraction of the price. I really love the new shape and size of the kindle HD. My daughter uses it and can control it great. I'm loving this new fire, mainly because I didn't fork out a couple hundred for it. My only beef is that magazines are formatted for the demensions of an iPad so don't look great on this Love my tablet easy to work and have no problem with down loads.and lite weight. I love this Kindle. I love the fact that you can use an SD card for more storage. Great job The device is priced just right to give as a gift for an 8 year old We have had a hard time with tablets and our 8 year old who has been down loading apps since she was around 3-4 years of age so far this tablet has survived everything except the constant draining of battery when used by her . This tablet is great for anyone who uses this for the basics.Load times can be a bit slow for browsing the web or streaming videos, but once it's loaded, it plays without buffering as long as you got internet speeds that are good enough. This tablet is a good size and great for pictures, downloaded videos and music. For its price, it makes a pretty good gift for someone wanting their first tablet. Bought one for the kids to use while we travel, lots of good free games. Installed VLC media player from the app store and filled up the SD drive with movies. Now they are nice and quite for hours on end.Battery life is awesome! Can't beat the value on this. 5 stars even though it has less apps than the play store. I had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things. The extra .5 RAM makes a difference. Very happy and if you're a Prime member there are lots of freebies! I find this fire much lighter and very easy to use Does great on browsing and doing research easy to use and love the features especially the private browsing a great price as well Great little tablet for a great price. I keep it at work for listening to music or some lunchtime reading. great tablet to replace kindle. Love the features. This is a great tablet for my teen. She loves it and the price can't be beat! The kindle is great to read on. I also like that you can play some games. I love the amazon tablet very much and love to use I bought this for my wife to replace her 7\" fire that was having a hard time holding a charge anymore. She is thrilled! It was easy for her to transfer all of her books and apps from her old fire to this. She mainly uses this for books , email and some games so this is the perfect tablet for her. better graphics and quicker with the 16gb storage Easy to read. Light in weight. Has many good features. I read about this new 8\" Amazon tablet in the New York Times. My Google Nexus 7, 4 years old, was getting slower and slower, and I needed to upgrade - for as little money as possible.This Amazon Fire 8\" is an excellent value for the money(only $89!) - very fast, great screen resolution, and easy to use. I was skeptical of the Silk browser, which I'd never heard of, but it works fine. There is no \"page forward\" arrow, which is odd, only backwards, but I can live with that.It has exceeded my expectations and I'm very happy with it. I'm not in the Amazon ecosystem, this is my first foray, and it's a good one! Congrats to Amazon for making an affordable, great quality tablet!Also, the purchasing experience at Best Buy was easy and convenient, as always! The new Fire HD 8 is an improvement over the Fire HD 7\". It is faster and the larger screen makes reading books much easier. I do wish the screen was easier to read when outside or in the car. Too much glare in those places. Love it! I'm not computer savy but was able to figure out most things without any help. Mother needed something since her tablet had died. Was lot easier for her to learn than her old table. She does lots more with Kindle than she did with tablet The new Fire HD 8 tablet is a nice upgrade over the previous version. Storage doubled to 16 GB and the RAM increased by 50% to 1.5 GB. This makes the tablet faster and more responsive. With the improved battery life and much lower price, this is a great general purpose tablet. I purchased it for my dad (70)He needed something easy to use. He really enjoys it. It a great product..,. The quality is awesome the pictures is good and clear... i have had not issues with my purchase. i found a great cover for it on line on amazon and use it every night. thank you for your service. This has a great picture, good size, lots of storage and a camera. Would recommend I went from the 7 inch Kindle to the 8 and it really made a difference. Easier to read and clearer than my old one. I love this Tablet. It's easy to use, a great price & lightweight. This is my second Kindle Fire HD. I was satisfied with the first one, but now I'm really enjoying the larger screen. My biggest need is to preserve the progress I've made in various games without having to replay them, but at least I have access to all my books, movies and games. Love the Kindle! Love the product. I use it every day for Web,Games and reading. I bought this to replace my wife's (1st generation) Kindle Fire. She likes it even better than the old one, especially the pinsharp screen. Great Kindle fire, works great for reading, playing games, etc. Highly recommend to everyone. Nice upgrade from my old kindle. I like it very much. For the price this is perfect. I read books, search the web, watch Netflix. It's not an iPad but for the price it is amazing! İt is cheap tablet option coming from amazon. Latest model will satisfy your needs This thing looks nice, runs nice and feels nice and for the price I don't think you can find a better tablet. The quality of display is better than expected for the price. (Keep in mind that this is not an iPad!). Apps from amazon are well integrated and the functionality is fully enjoyable without limitation. Very satisfied with the product. This review is for Fire HD 8, 16 GB. Beautiful HD resolution on this tablet. Love the 8\" size, not too big nor too small. This is an awesome tablet, fast, great display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment If you look for a great tablet for entertainment this is the best you can have, if you want a tablet for working applications this is not the one so be aware and buy this tablet if you want tons of entertainment. also it have a larger processor and internal memory and the external memory to keep all your photos is unbelievable I strongly recommend it, again, not for work but for entertainment. I bought 2, 1 for each kid. Easy to set up and figure iut. I went with the staff member's recommendation and I am so glad I did. I love the internet safety organ on it through Amazon. $2.50 a month per kid for unlimited age related and child safe Internet access and movies, books, games and apps and I can set the time it shuts off and a minimum time for them to read each day. Love love love. Very happy with my kindle. Would buy it for my kids So I got my Fire HD 8 originally for ebooks since e-copies are much cheaper. Very easy to use, especially if you are not tech friendly. So glad I got this. Bought the Kindle for my daughter. It's the 4th we have bought over the years, one for each child. Great product Husband loves the 8\" tablet. The screen is big enough to view what he is reading For first tablet I am pleased. An amazon name is good value. This is a good product for the price. Many more things can be done with this fire 8 than we dreamed about. Easy access to my Amazon account. Easy to set up and use. This item has a very nice readout, and is well built as far as I can tell. The overall size is very suitable, and the price was reasonable. I get great service at Best Buy every time I shop there. Does everything I needed and moreI use it as a travel companion and the size is great. Its so perfect for my niece & she loves it. Going to get another one for my son. the performance is so much faster than my old one and the graphics are much better too. Love my kindle it does everything I wanted I to do. I wanted a tablet that was easy to use that I could access my email, internet and stream shows/movies! It's perfect! As expected. I am very happy with this. This serves the purpose Handy to use and size is good. It's light weight and that's important. I got this for my husband birthday and he loves it This kindle is great. Battery lasts much longer than old kindle. Where do I begin...good clarity, I love the size and storage capacity! Very affordable, love watching Netflix on it. I do wish I could have gotten the purple, got the color black, but overall I'm very happy with my purchase. I didn't think to much of it at first glad at the store, I decided to purchase it. IT WAS THE BEST DECISION EVER MADE I went into Best But to buy another reader but ended up buying a Fire 8; good value and has the things I need in a reader. Got the tablet for my grandson he's happy with it and use it as we speak Great buy. Bought it for my 10 year old niece. She loves it. The Kindle Fire HD has a larger screen (8\" vs. 7\") and images are crisper with more vibrant colors. Just lock the card out and let the kids go crazy!! This is an awesome tablet perfectly for watch tv for my little nephew I'm so glad i brought this because it is very handy and easy to use too. Everything about it is good and I really like it. I purchased this tablet for my Autistic child. He loves it!! I've enjoyed using my Fire HD8 tablet to play games. Beautiful screen, vibrant color, fast and best quality for the money. I use it for downloading and reading books. It is the perfect size for this purpose. It is also very light. Much better screen resolution than my 7 inch fire. I bought this tablet for my Mom and she loves it. I used it myself and it's very easy to use and works nicely with Amazon Prime, etc. definitely would recommend especially for the price. This really a nice tablet.It runs great and it's thin and easy to hold. This tablet is quick and as good as my iPad! I use the tablet specifically for one aspect of my life and it performs great! I am pleasantly surprised by its performance! I have a 4 year old boy and 6 year old girl and 12 year old boy no cracks or broken yet yes they have dropped them no case but no cracks yet pretty amazing when they drop it on hard wood floors and still not broke!! Wow I've had quite a few different kindles over the years and I've loved all of them. But this kindle fire hd 8 is by far my favorite. So glad my husband bought it for me the best purchase ever. Upgraded from a standard Fire tablet. Better screen, a bit faster than standard Fire. In my opinion this the absolute best value on a tablet out there. No way to go wrong at this price the new sound and the faster speed plus other improvments are great I am very happy with this Amazon tablet. I purchased it for business purposes, as well as recreational, and it works great for both. I did get an SD card for more memory. Also, if I would have bought directly from Amazon, there would've been a 1 month wait. However, I was able to order from Best Buy online, and pick it up that very day!!! Its perfect to see my tv series when i don't have my tv around. It has a very good resolution quality. I bought the 8\" to replace my old 7\". I love the bigger screen I got myself 1 of these tablets and so far I love the way it works You can enlarge the print and change the lighting to make it easier to read. The only thing with it is you must have an Amazon account to use it. This kindle rocks! Tons of storage at an awesome price. bought it as a gift for my mother and she loves it I love the fire....it works great and the navigation through the Fire is user friendly too. I think the 8 is the better buy for your money. BY FAR THE BEST TABLET IVE EVER OWNED, EASY AND QUICK SET UP This tablet is very good especially considering the price. also has memory slot to increase storage. I bought this tablet over the holidays when it was on sale. It has been a great tablet. The battery life is great on these new models. Also playing games everything moves smoothly since it has more ram. The durability of the tablet is great. This thing won't break if you drop it. The only thing I don't like is the fire os. You can't get everything you can get on the google store so not all apps are available. I have had a few kindle's in the past so this was nothing new for me but what I loved about this one is that the screen is big so when I am reading a book it's a lot easier than when I had the first kindle screen. I mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when I want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing. I love it! Great tablet for on the go. Good size screen to watch movies or read book. Light, portable and great features. Highly recommended. Bought it for a friend he likes it.would recommend it. This tablet was everything I was looking for: a cheap tablet that could download Netflix shows for offline viewing Unlike my first Kindle, this tablet gives me all kinds of information, advertisements and offers when I first turn it on. I could live without that, but overall, I am pleased with this new tablet. It does many things I haven't taken the time to explore, but hope to soon. This is a great tablet with great features. I love my kindle. Can't beat the price on this tablet! Great for streaming or casual games. Good value at a very affordable price. Can't beat it. We love this so much in our home. We bought a super tough case and let our two and six year old use it. They love watching their movies on it and playing different apps. It is a really good value! Great tablet! Brought this for my wife and she loves reading off of it! Great price, easy to use! Great purchase! Very fast, very functional. Love the e-reader function. Movies, music and internet work great. LOVE IT! I received this as a gift from my husband. It's great for reading, gaming and watching Netflix. My daughter loves her tablet. I had to make sure I brought a case because it is very thin. No problems and I can see everything she downloads Have a fire 7 and wanted a bigger screen, love the new one. Perfect for our needs and an on the go mini computer and ereader. I initially bought the tablet for school, I use Kindle to rent books but after using it to stream Xfinity, Netflix, and Amazon Prime I loved the sound and picture quality. I would recommend this to anyone needing a good low cost tablet with great battery life. We have had no issues with this tablet. Love it!TY My first tablet experience and it's awesome. I love being able to stream movies and have numerous apps at my fingertips. Love this tablet. Power lasts long. Short charge time. HD screen is really clear. Only con is that there are some apps not available like Google play. Very satified. Have a 128gb card in mine . Plenty of space for downloads. The camera has no flash and is not the best but I didnt buy this tablet for that. High recommend the HD tablet 8gb amazon fire. You want go wrong. This tablet does all the things I really need. I have it some thought before buying I don use most of the features a more expensive computer/tablet has. Have been very happy with my purchase. Got this for my wife's birthday. She had an older model and wanted an upgrade. She seems very happy with it and uses it every day Very user friendly...long lasting battery....very clear display Easy to transfer my stuff from my old Kindle into this new one. Love the price and how easy it is to use. Great buy. This is my first kindle. It works great for my use. Mostly reading, email, and Amazon shopping. Amazon Fire HD8 is one of the best deal at 89$. Strong, efficient, low price and some Amazon features that I love. Youtube videos of how to get googleplay and android apps have made things lot more easier. And now, microsoft office is available online for free that I can access and edit my documents. What else do I need? Amazon is more respectable brand name than other low price brands or used/old models of high price brands. Definitely recommend it. I held off getting a tablet and wish I had done it sooner. The Amazon Fire 8 is great and easy to use Works great for everything we want our daughter to do it's wonderful. I love it. It's easy to watch movies, play games and read books. love it just like my other one just better!!! since I already own a kindle I knew this was what I wanted. Just needed a second one and a little bigger. Always loved the service and help I get at BB so I knew I would purchase it there!! Found salesman to be knowledgeable and most helpful. Thanks so much for your help and service It fits just right in your hand. Light weight. Love it I extremely happy with my purchase. I like that the screen is just a little bigger and much faster. Good picture, works well, great variety of apps. keep in mind that you get apps from amazon, not google play, so they aren't always the same or same price This replaced my old Kindle Fire. I have not yet explored all of the features but, so far, it is performing very well. Tablet is a good size and weight, and easy to use. This tablet has been the best one for the price we have purchased 3 other tabs for our kids and they have all broke and ran super slow they love them would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save a buck but want quality I would recommend this product it is a good tablet to use have had no problems. I love my Kindle fire. Had a Kindle and it disappeared. Enjoy not having to go to library for books. I get a great selection of books every day. For the price the tablet can not be beat. I use this over my ipads that i have. There is nothing i cant do with this tablet I recently upgraded to this tablet; it is everything I wanted. Highly recommend! This is a great tablet for the price! I bought it to replace my iPad mini. Great for ereading and general browsing. This replaced a Kindle 7 HDX with 32GB of ram. The older tablet had a charging port that wasn't functioning anymore. Had the Geek Squad warranty so they issued a full credit for the old tablet and my son chose the HD8 as his new tablet. Other than the screen resolution being lower and less memory, great tablet. My son didn't care about the resolution and the new Kindles let you pop in an SD card for more storage. Popped in a 64GB SD card and he's a happy camper now.. ;) I purchased this as a gift but have had extensive time with it. It's a great budget tablet, phenomenal screen and a very smooth interface. Handles all apps and HD content well. This was a birthday gift to my husband. He really likes it and it does what he needs it to do I \"retired\" an earlier version and this new souped up model more than meets my needs, and the battery lasts so much longer!! I have a kindle and wanted more options. I love the bigger screen. I find it easy to read. It can have some reflection under lights but not much. Liked this Kindle upgrade. The color screen and backlights allowed for easy night use My previous Kindle was dying and I wanted a new replacement fast. I went to Amazon and while they had one it was back ordered a month. Expecting to pay more I went to Best Buy and not only found it for the same price but even better it was available at my local store and I could pick it up the same day! Easy to use You cant beat it for the price you pay This Kindle is larger than my old one and book reading is much easier. Some features I don't use so can't comment on them. All in all I love it.The only drawback was that the store had no covers that fit this Kindle. Tablet is great and easy to use thankfully because its my 1st tablet This is an item that is easy to use for novices. My child uses it and has no issues No problems with tablet, kids love it and the size is great Was a present for my 14 year old grandson. He was very pleased. For under $100 this 8\" tablet is a bargain. I do all I want on it like; check email, Facebook, Twitter, watch YouTube, read books, and shop on eBay or Amazon. I've been very pleased with my purchase. Bought this for my wife for our anniversary she loves it I love to read and this tablet work great for my needs. I bought it for my grand daughter, she knew how to use it right away. You can purchase a rubber case in different colors for protection. This device is great for the price! I use it for my daughter and after having seeing the ads on amazon, I thought this would perfect for her. I think that the Amazon Kindle tablet was a great purchase for my teenage daughter and grandson, very easy to operate. It kept them entertained for hours while we were traveling on the train for vacation. Great device. Works very well and use it throughout the day.Keeps me informed and great for looking up things and staying in contact. I have done this like 5 times now. Don't send me this ahs8n. Getting aggravating. Love how I am able to run the latest Minecraft on this device, but am not able to on a 3-year-old iPad. It seems as apple handy cap their devices. Resolution may not be the best, but for the little buggers it works fine I love my Fire HD8 I got it because my Kindle(the original) that my husband bought me died and the Verizon Tablet wasn't working great for me. So I came down and the agent at store showed me this one, there is a learning curve but it gets better and takes a while to learn but I love it. Does all the basic stuff I need at a great price. I use it for some apps, web browsing and some video. Picked this over the Fire 7\" for the screen size, resolution and CPU/GPU. Battery life is pretty good. Ads aren't too annoying.Far cheaper than competing name-brand budget tablets while doing almost everything needed at this level and probably better supported. FireOS will always be a little behind the current Android version and I'd rather have Google Play than Amazon, but this still allows for side-loading stuff.Recommend if you're ok with living in Amazon's world and/or proficient enough to load other app stores or packages (or know somebody can). this item work just as I expected it to, great product! Have a nook , this is much better has more apps and thru amazon I love the size and the HD quality. Just what I was looking for!Downloads apps really fast! Never thought a tablet at this price could be this good. Totally recommended! This is my sixth unit and has features many of the newer models didn't have. Thank.............................................. I love the apps that are on here and everything else I think it's the perfect tablet for a beginner has all of the apps that you will need Love this tablet. 16GB memory but have expansion slot. Bought 128GB micro SD card for $56. Love this feature I love Amazon Fire HD8... It is so easy to use and perfect for reading books on or cruising Social Media. I love that it has Alexa included on it. Bought this so the grandkids could use it. They already have one at their house. My husband has been using it also & he likes it. He has never used a tablet before but he has enjoyed it. This is a fantastic tablet for the price. This is a great alternative to an IPad. I had an original Kindle that I replaced with this newer one. I love it!! I purchased this tablet for my 9 year old son and he loves it. Nice bright screen and has two speakers for pretty good sound for a tablet. Great for games and watching videos. This was purchased on Black Friday as an impulse buy and we absolutely love it! It was a great price and the size of the tablet is perfect. It works great! Great little tablet for someone who is always on the go. I love my tablet no regrets the pic are great I recommend it! It's a great item to have when you are out and about. It's easy to connect to Wi-Fi and it's small enough to fit in my purse. Nice product for the price. It does what we need it to do. Easy to use and handy to have with you instead of a heavy laptop. This was a surprise when we opened it up! Bright and colorful!! Nice look. Great memory and camera. For this much money everything is so good. Bought this for my niece for Christmas. She mostly uses as ereader and checking email. Good tablet for the price. Nice display good performance. Loved my first kindle so the upgrade to the new one was practically seamless. This is I think the best product I've bought. I already own eight that I've purchased through the years for my family and they seem to only get better and less expensive in price. I have been completely satisfied with this product. The quality of graphics is great and downloads are a breeze. I would definitely recommend this product. I bought this as a present for a friend, and he uses it all the time. The HD screen is crystal clear, and this tablet competes well with the bigger names. My dad is a first time user for anything techie he has really enjoyed it. Bought this for my great granddaughter for a gift. She loves it and it is easy for her to use Was bought for a Christmas gift. My 11 year old son loves it. A friend of mine was in the market for a new tablet. I had researched the Fire tab for some time and liked the specs, which met her needs. I decided to buy her one for her b day, SHE LOVES IT! im always using my amazon tablet...perfect for games!!! Great price. Fantastic gift! I would recommend this for a gift for all ages. I love to read! Having the Kindle Fire is like having hundreds of books at my fingertips! Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. Reads it all the time! Great all around tablet. Color and resolution is very nice. Best price for a nice product. I use this all the time. So much better than bringing out the laptop. Nice it all ready has Amazon and apps built in. Great buy.

Easier researching things , lot more options etc Really enjoy my kindle. Fits perfect in my purse and the screen is a good size. I bought this for Christmas for my husbandand now I 've had it for months. I am still happy with this purchase. It has a nice screen and is easy to see what you are viewing. I will be buying another one for myself soon. I really like the feel and ease of use. It's a great tablet for the price. This is a great tablet. I was surprised at how efficient and easy to use it is. I bought 8 of these for gifts to make Bible study easier for a bunch of friends. We purchased this for my wife's mother. She likes to play games on it and do some reading. So far I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. Great product for a great price! I use this while underway and it's a perfect size to travel with Love it. Great gift. Awesome for those who don't have a tablet or never used one Works great with my amazon prime account and for browsing Internet and playing game. Cheap tablet as well. I am extremely happy with my purchase. The kindle is very fast and the screen is clear. The Fire HD8 tablet is so easy and fun to use. Take it everywhere. Love that it is easier to see than a cell phone, for those with old eyes. My wife's mom wanted a tablet. This was a great way to get her into technology and she LOVES it. Not iPad or galaxy but good start. I purchased b/c my old kindle fire finally bit it ...screen went dark. Very happy with this one. Cost is great. The screen resolution is great. User friendly. My favorite feature is the SD card so you can add more gb. Our son just LIVES this unit. He has all his favorite games on it. I bought this kindle for the extra size. I have recently been having trouble with seeing clearly so I figured with the size it may be easier. It was and I really like being able to change the color of the fonts and background, it seems to help immensely. Great budget tablet at a great price. Long battery life and high quality display. I traded this in after receiving a 7\" at Christmas and I am happy I did. I love the size of the screen for reading my books (which I have too many of) and a great size for watching movies. I do wish I had the capability to use internet when I am away from home, yet other than that, this is a great buy. I was going to get a Samsung tablet but for doing everything this is better I needed to replace my old reader, and found that this model was just as good. if not better, and at a greatly lower price. I have enjoyed using it for about a month, and am very please with it. I didn't expect anything less than what I got with this Kindle. Bought this for my daughter to replace a worn out ipad. She is happier with the size. The resolution is nice. Great buy for the price I have only used this a few times so far, but I like it. The lightweight and pretty easy to navigate. Perfect screen size too. I ended up purchasing a second one for my fiancé. The size of this table is great I'm able to carry it in my purse with no problem! Really nice customer first service. I have had other Kindle readers before so was familiar with the unit. Before the 8 inch kindle we the old 7 inch one, which both tablets are great but this one so much nicer. The screen is bigger, more storage amd Love the color on the back. Great Tablet I'm enjoying the longer battery life, faster processing and most of all the ability to expand the memory. Highly Recommended! She loves it . it's the best thing we could of ever brought her Bought this tablet for my son and he has loved it. It's so easy for him to use and easy for me to set parental controls. I use it to read books. Have read a lot of books on it. The right size and lighting for any situation. I bought this for my computer loving 89-year-old dad. Now he can check his emails from his chair rather than having to go into his computer room! Bought on Black Friday for $60, add a trifold case, portable TV while I do dishes/cook/anything Got this when it was on sale which is what really made it worth getting. Tablet works well, slim design is perfect. Highly recommended to purchase this tablet. Perfect purchase for me. I take it everywhere and is so easy to use! Purchased this a couple of weeks ago, no complaints so far. Web pages load pretty quickly on the Silk browser, and the battery life is excellent. After installing Google Play Store (it's really easy!) even more apps are available. Can't beat this for under a hundred dollars!!! After having a basic Kindle for 6 years, I moved up. I am thrilled with all this product can do. I am an avid reader. The Fire let's me do that and lots of other things. I am still finding apps, and other things it will do. I know this sounds \"old fashioned\", but it would be great to have a user's manual! Thanks for asking. Bought as a replacement kindle for my mother in law. She loves it perfect size for her. This is my 4 the Kindle and is well worth the price. My wife loves this tablet.Much easier to use than previous 2 tablets that we purchased. It's great!! Light weight! Charges quickly! Great features! Nicer than my old fire. Better screen area to view My husband and I both use this and really love it. We got kindle unlimited for the books but it's also great for playing games and surfing the web too. Love my new Kindle Fire - easy to use - the battery life is amazing!! Perfect size for reading watching movies and carrying on a plane I upgraded from a 7 to an 8 inch. What a difference. Totally satisfied would recommend this to everyone I know seems a lot better, does not have the open cover feature, which I miss, but still getting used to the differences and trying to get my thing back on that I had on the old 1 Really easy to use, nice size, works great, affordable price, extra card slot for storage, bright screen, good speakers, easy to download apps, bought this for my niece and it works perfect, she easily navigates all menus and features... An inexpensive tablet that can satisfy your reading and viewing pleasure. Fast and good quality product. Recommended! I Bought this as a gift for my daughter! She is diabetic and losing her vision. I am hoping the large text will be easier for her to see so she keeps reading. I have ordered a couple of these for my family members and say that they work great and do everything that they are supposed too. Highly recommend. Lightweight, performant, and packed with features. This device is great for reading, music, or movies on the go as well as web browsing and email. Easy to use, like lighted screen for reading in dark I am very satisfied with this product. It performs extremely well in all areas of its operation. We bought one of these for my daughter to help with her learning. There are so many possibilities with this. It's way cheaper than an Ipad and does basically the same thing. I absolutely love my Fire tablet. Great size, lots of space and a great reader. I can't recommend this product enough. I I bought this for a friend since she liked mine so much.It is a great way to check emails and read Kindle e-Books.I keep an SD card in mine and store my books on it. You can just drop this in your purse to read on the go. Husband is a first time user, he is doing really well with it.. He has low vision problems and this made reading his favorite books a lot easier to read. Love customer service very knowledgeable and helpful Very good tablet for the price economical and the ability to carry in backpack I bought this Kindle for my husband's birthday. I have had a Kindle since 2013 and I used it mostly to read and check emails while travelling. My husband is not particularly a book reader, but he spends way too many hours alone, in his office, reading his face book messages. Now, with the new Kindle he actually multi-tasks, in the living room, on facebook, email, and internet, at least in proximity to me, so he might even join me in a conversation! I think his Kindle has much imporoved our 35 year marriage! It is easy to use. It was cheap. Have not found anything about it that I do not like. i really love this product because it lets me read books and surf the net Love this tablet. Bought it to be my touch screen remote for my harmony hub, but use it for so much more now. make sure you buy a micro sd card with at least 64 gb of memory. or you will have to constantly delete old items. Up and coming new technology helps everyone to enjoy life more greatly This is the perfect tablet for my purposes. Easy to use and the perfect size. Not too large and not too small. This device is s really good piece of electronic. It is a good reader and also is very good for my 2 year old granddaughter to use. For my son as a present for college books. 5 textbooks were 1/4 the price on kindle than if we bought them on Amazon, this is my third kindle. Other two still working great, My bf got me this as a birthday present from my son. It's just like my 7\" although larger. I cannot tell the different between the regular and the HD and I game on it. I'm not sure if it cost more, but wouldn't waste the money if it did. Very satisfied for $39.95 sales price. Way faster than I expected. My new Kindle is an upgrade from my 7 year old Kindle Fire. As to be expected the video quality is better along with faster performance and more features. I still use my old Kindle as it is still ticking but the \"shiny new toy\" is fun. I can play games, surf the internet or watch movies. I can check my e-mail or just about do anything I can do on a regular computer.I strongly recommend it. This is a terrific tablet at a great price. The quality is excellent, the price is right, it has tons of storage capacity. And oh, did I mention that it's cheap? (Cheap for a tablet, that is.) Had a great experience with my Best Buy rep! Great Job! I bought the HD Fire 7 for my wife,I liked hers decided to buy the Fire HD 8 for myself I love it.Nice graphics easy to use. I have used the Kindle mostly for reading. I have downloaded books from Amazon, some free some purchased, that I have heard about for years and now will read. I have also read Manga from the Internet. My use of the internet has also included looking up gardening hints, animal care, and dog breed characteristics. This was a gift for my son and he loves it. It not only helps him with his homework but he could also play games on it! Great for my mom who isn't tech savvy. Luv it! :-) Love the kindle will continue to buy them for my family awesomeness, love how i xan watch my xfinity movies This tablet is not only a great price but exactly what I needed for quick Internet access and to download books ! I purchased the Amazon Fire HD 8 to replace my 2nd generation Kindle Fire. It works great and the colors are sharp. The 8 is bigger and lighter weight than my old 7 and the battery life is longer. It also has more storage and a camera. Love it! I lost my tablet in Germany and wanted a replacement fast. Best Buy, had both the 7 and 8 inch Kindle fires in stock, after reading the reviews, I decided to go with the 8 inch. Boy was I glad that I did, the larger viewing area, is great for watching movies and Netflix on the airplane. The 8 inch has stereo sound , unlike the 7 inch which has only mono. Overall I am really happy with this tablet Pros - HD quality for low price. Works really well with my Amazon account to access multiple Amazon features with extreme ease. Couldn't be happier. I have iPads too which are extremely versatile but they came with a big price but not this tablet. Love it! A very good product by amazon. Considering the price, even better. Excellent product. I would definitely purchase again. After using this tablet for a while, I have found that I even prefer this size over my iPad Air. Easy to carry around and long battery life make this my preferred device. The screen is just the perfect size for my older eyes, the screen on the 7\" fire is just too small and cramped, and it seemed a lot less responsive. I highly recommend this sweet tablet. This was a BIRTHDAY GIFT for my LITTLE one and she LOVED it! I purchased two of these as Christmas presents for my children. I had been researching child friendly tablets with robust controls to keep them away from undesirable content. I found the 7\" Fire Kids Edition, but after looking over the specs and reviews, I found myself unsure of it. I was mostly interested in the FreeTime application, so I did some research on that and found that it was available on other Fire models also. I came across the new Fire HD8, which had more power, a better screen, and far better battery life at a very affordable price point. I gave them a shot and I'm glad I did.I have the Fire HD8's locked into FreeTime mode, so the only activities that can be done are ones that I approve of, but if I want to, I can pick up either of them and unlock them to access Netflix/Amazon Prime or anything else I desire. I currently have reading goals set up that they must achieve before they are able to access videos or games, and those are limited to X amount of time per day. FreeTime also has a bedtime feature which disables/enables the use of the tablets during designated times, which is amazing.The hardware itself is exceptional. The screen resolution is excellent, it's very responsive, and the battery life is spectacular! They advertise up to 12 hours of battery life, and depending on screen brightness, ours last almost that long regularly. The only con I can think of is that the cameras are sub-par, but that's not what I purchased the tablets for, so it's a non-issue for myself.Some of the reviews I read cited that the internal storage was easily filled with FreeTime content, so I installed 128GB SD cards in them. I also purchased some rugged children's cases for them off of Amazon.This is probably one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. The sound of silent children reading all day is priceless!!! I bought this tablet for my sister to replace her kindle. We love it except for the fact it would not connect to ATT internet. I suspect this was an ATT problem. The internet could not be authenticated. Since we have had problems with ATT for seven years, I am sure it was a problem with them! Once my sis read the instructions, she was good to go! works great for us for video calling, for kids watching videos I own two Amazon fire tablets with this one being the same as owned.. My sister in law wanted a tablet and since I owned one just like this one I figured it to be a good buy.. She just loves it, she is able to do her scheduling, read books and watch her news programs.. It's a great Alertanative to an iPad... great price and just as powerful for a lot less cost.. We bought this tablet for our son in college and he loves it. Replaced my hd fire 7 because broke screed. Very pleased with the large screen. Purchased as a gift. The receiver loves it and said that it works nicely. Purchased this for my 80 year old mother in law to replace her old cracked screen one. Everything was perfect easy to use and set up. She has zero problems using this for online and reading books. Love it I sent one down to my family in Mexico they loved it Bought this as a gift for my mother. She absolutely loves it. Easy to set up and use. and the price was right. I am loving this tablet. My previous tablet was a 1st year Fire. This tablet is great for reading, games,facebook and emails. This is my third Kindle and I have loved them all. I still have my first Kindle and use it. I just wore my Kindle Fire out with 5 + years use. I am very happy with everything my new one can do. No disappointments at all. Got it for my Dad. Easy to use and he loves it. Good stepping stone for future producs One of the best purchases or investments you could make for technology. I bought it for kindle books and was amazed by its overall features. Its Kindle with features of a TAB. I bought this primarily for reading, but, being a tablet it is able to do so much more! I can listen to music, download movies and check email. I love it! Way better than my Nook! i would buy this item again. however charging port is I got this tablet for my mother and cousins. It's been very speedy to my surprise, not as fast as a high end tablet but no lag and a very nice 720p display with good build quality. Would definitely recommend if your looking for an affordable tablet YOU PAY FOR THE BEST AND YOU GET THE BEST. THANK YOU BEST BUY FOR PROVIDING THIS PRODUCT I have an older Kindle and enjoyed it very much. However, there is so much more improvement in this tablet with faster processing speed, upgradable storage and longer battery life. I'm really happy! This was the perfect tablet for what my husband wanted. 8\" size was not too big or too small. You can carry it without it being clumsy to drop. I love my kindle.It is user friendly and there's so much more than I thought. Awesome tablet and great value for money. My son is enjoying it a lot. I bought this as a cheap alternative to an old, slow, iPad 2, until I could spring for the iPad Pro. Got it as a Black Friday deal, so it was more than worth it. Was able to add some missing apps that make it even better than I thought it could be, and having Amazon Prime makes it an inexpensive and handy media device. I carry it in my bag at all times without having to worry about it's value. Can't beat it for the price. I love to read! Books,books, books and more books. Longtime Apple user, but for this price vs an iPad you can't beat this product! Easy to use. Great picture clarity. Wish they had a cellular version. This is a good tablet to own. I like the features. My son needed a tablet to take notes on at college classes. He wanted something small and lightweight instead of taking his laptop. He's found it to work perfectly for what he needs! Love the added space. Easy to move around in. I am excited to use all the new features. Gave as Christmas gift,and wife loved it. She has not put it down since she has gotten it. I love this new Amazon Fire HD. I have a 6 year old and I've set it up so that he has his own password and he loves to read all the free books available. The different shades of back lights are cool. If you purchase the new Amazon Fire HD, it will enhance your reading experience. We had an old Fire and upgraded to the Fire HD. Love everything about it so far. The fire tablet is a great tool for reading, surfing the web, playing games and even watching some Netflix, on a bigger screen, without killing a cell phone charge. Great value! This tablet is great for everything. It's not as powerful as an iPad but the price can't be beat. I like that it is a good reader and that you can also put some apps on it -- I use it to check email, one note, etc. but primarily as a reader. Got this tablet cause I wanted to start reading more graphic novels and manga and was very impressed with it it runs smooth and even use Hulu and netflix on it. My only flaw with it is that there are ads on your lock screen though you can take them off for $15 other than that it's a grade little tablet! My wife wanted this and I got it for her. She has been totally happy with it. She loves it for its size for reading online books. Great tablet. Easy to use. Will recommend it to others. The HD8 and HD7 are amazing for the price. They aren't top powered tablets, but they're functional tablets. Right now, in Feb 2017, either one is a good replacement for the Nexus 7. Bought this for my niece and she loves it. Very easy to use from what she tells me! Such a a great tablet that does everything, love it! I am an avid Amazon user for shopping and tablets, I bought a different model for my younger brother and now purchased this one for my grandparents and they love it! I purchased this for my parents who were always viewing facebook or other videos on their cell phones, this Amazon tablet is perfect for them! It's user friendly and if you have an Amazon Prime account has great access to movies and music. I bought one for my 9 year old son for his birthday - and now we are buying another one for our ten year old. We have had some tech issues as we are juggling three tablets on one account - but with careful monitoring, it's ok. Wonderful little buy! Tired of my bulky tablet. This one stays charged a lot longer! I like because I can download movies to watch offline with netflix I always wanted a tablet and finally decided on the amazon fire 8. It is awesome and I love it.I downloaded some games and I am enjoying them. It is great for internet too. Definitely worth the price. You get a lot for the money. It had lots more options too. It was okay, but most of my apps were stripped down versions on the HD-Fire. It was inexpeisve, but you get what you pay for. The O/S is pretyy premitive. The hardware does fell nice. I would say it is the perfect device for an older or younger person. I have owned several kindles. I don't know what I do to them, but they tend to die rather quickly. Thank goodness for Best Buy's extra protection. The last two that quit on me were replaced quickly and effortlessly. Excellent customer service as well! Love using this Kindle to look up real estate sales, play mind games, and take pictures. Love the bigger screen and the great resolution. Sound is also far superior to my older model Lindle. Wife loves it. She said it opens much faster and likes auto updates for apps. This Tablet does absolutely everything I want! I can watch TV Shows or Movies, check my Mail, Facebook, Google.......pay all my bills. It processes fast and has a beautiful screen. As I said: Everything I want in a Tablet for less than $100! And she has been happy about it ever since. Not being that tech saavy, this specific device has a user-friendly tutorial to help get started. I have had a Samsung Tablet for 3 years, and I have to say that I love this Amazon Kindle 10x better. The picture quality is amazing, it is light weight, it is easy to navigate. Great tablet, great screen, great price! Very user friendly, especially for a not so Tech savvy person. This is as good as my my Ipod!

Great device very functional love it will recommend Bought this for my Father-In-Law for Christmas and he loves it. Easy to use and has already bought 5 books for it! Can't say enough good about it. My 10 year old loves it. Enjoy the Kindle, fun games, can access the Internet, read books, etc. Bought this for my elderly mother who was wanting the ability to read and/or listen to books. After a slow start getting her going (she is not tech savvy) she is really enjoying the versatility of this tablet. Although it does not have cellular data ability, which she had no use for, it gives her the flexibility to connect to wireless networks when she makes her weekly casino visits. Books and magazines are easy to access and read!!! serves all my needs in a economy tablet and I would reccomend it to all. Good product with best price available in the market place Tablet is a great tool to use the world wide web and check email. Great tablet. Picture is super sharp and so easy to read. Love this tablet. It's big enough so I can see. It works with my prime so I can watch movies or stream music. I purchased a Kindle a few years ago and Have loved the flexibility it give me. I can browse the internet without moving to my desk to get on my personal computer. I love the fact that I can continue to read my books while I travel. Doctor Office Visits seem to just roll by more calmly now because I can ignore the office chatter and the TV selections I rather not watch. I encouraged others to make the purchase and several have done just that. This is my second purchase. Love It! I purchased this for my mother and she has been going on about how wonderful the Amazon fire is. It's the perfect size easy to use and she can even do her banking on it which she loves.

Bigger screen, slimmer and lighter. Great tablet just what my wife wanted, loves the wifi, much better than her old one. Was a gift and they love the tablet! Its a great price and works awesome! The amazon fire tablet 2016 is quite good. It provides sufficient content & ability to do all of the basics one requires in a tablet. The 8 inch screen is bright and provides various settings. The tablet's light weight makes it very portable. Need to buy a tablet for my Mother as a Christmas gift. Functionality is great and she uses it for all her online needs The Fire HD 8 is the perfect size EReader. Big enough to see the text but small enough to hold comfortably. I bought this Amazon Fire HD8 as a Christmas present for my wife. It is the second tablet I have given to her over the past 5 years. She LOVES it! It goes wherever she goes. The Fire is more than portable and so easy to use. As the saying goes: \"A Happy Wife Means A Happy Life\". I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Fire to anyone! Gave this to my daughter for Christmas. She loves it. Uses it every day. Good buy! This is my second Kindle Fire, and the only reason is because I upgraded. They're a great little tablet. Very versatile and fast loading times. Definitely recommend. Good quality android tablet. also makes a very nice gift. Can't say enough about the Kindle Fire. It literally is fiiiiiiyah... fast, easy to use, and an all-around perfect tablet. Recommend keeping an eye out for special pricing at holidays to save some cheddar, but otherwise I'd say pick this little black rectangle of portable interwebz awesomeness up the first chance you get. The best product for the money. East to use, great color, great features. easy to set up and battery life is great. I bought this one for 40$ during the black Friday sale, as a gift to my cousin. He was flattered by the performance, even I didn't expect it to be this good! It works flawlessly with the usual games and apps, what you are going to miss the most is YouTube, amazon's app store does not have youtube. Other than that it meets all my requirements for daily use. Best B It is helping them to learn to read and follow directions .Best Buy had the products and provided great customer service. Grandsons are enjoying product use. This tablet exceeds its reviews. its easy to use and the screen is great. My husband and I purchased the new Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8 tablets for our 16 yr old son and 12 yr old daughter for Christmas. I have an older version 7 in myself so I already knew we were buying a durable tablet. The new ones are awesome and they had them in colors so very easy to distinguish who's is whom We purchased during Black Friday and got them for $30 off, which was an amazing discount and made me love it even more. We had shopped around many places prior to and. They are light weight and the screen is plenty big enough for them to watch movies, play games, do homework and video calls friends and family out of town. They seem to have plenty of space and nice to know that we can add memory if we need to.The tablets hold up to the everyday life of the kids accidental drops kicks and their 3 yr old sister lol. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a new tablet for themselves or children. Will buy again in the future if these ever quick working. Bought it for my little grandson he likes games, he can play with it where ever there is wifi. Good tablet and a great price. I use it for reading, Netflix and email. Won the kindle fire 6 last xmas2015 at work raffle. Gladly got this kindle fire 8 for a bigger screen and better battery life. Love it. One of the best inexpensive tablets on the market. Great for the casual user Loving this tablet, 5 stars in my opinion, definitely worth it. Easy and fun to use. Also, a perfect size even for a man's hand. Bought as a gift and they love it! Great for the price. This is a great reading product. Love the light adjustment in low light areas. I can adjust the font sizes for my reading comfort and I can do other things like download apps or watch movies! i really loved my 7in. but i love 8.5 in. a whole lot.!!!!!!!!!!!!!thanks guys!!! Have not had time to REALLY use it, but hope to download books and games. This is a great, easy to use tablet for the price. It's a 16 GB mini-computer and camera perfect for trips. Needed a present for mom, at first she didn't use it much cause she had to set it up but now it's great and she loves it. Bought this for my 83-year old Mother. She loves it! We bought it two days before it went on sale for Christmas and Best Buy was excellent with price matching asesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! performs as designed got it on sale for 79 dollars Is great for my son 8 years old, they help with homework We own an ipad,samsug tablets and we have both love are fire8's wave better. This tablet was affordable and it's pretty decent. At first was going to get a iPad but I decided to get this instead way cheaper then a iPad and just as good, love it.. Couldn't recommend this more for kids. Price and features are awesome along with parental controls. I didn't actually use as I bought for a gift. My grandson already had one so we returned for a pair if 3-d goggles. use as a reader and music, games watches movies i good all round tablet Just thought we were purchasing a capability to download and read books, magazines, etc. But, for such a low price was surprised at the total capabilities available. I GOT THE FIRE HD SO MY KIDS COULD READ BOOKS , PLAY GAMES AND WATCH THEIR SHOWS . WITHOUT SPENDING AN ARM AND A LEG FOR THE TABLET. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TABLE FOR KIDS / YOUNG TEENS WHO WANT TO HAVE A TABLET BUT NOT BREAK THE BANK. We bought one for my wife and my mother-in-law and they both love it. Very easy to use. My kids love it. Battery life is longer than others. This was a gift for my mother who is 99 years. She used to love puzzles, but with arthritis and failing eyesight she couldn't do them. The puzzle app is good because she can see it and use finger to slide pieces. She can keep up with family on Facebook Very decent tablet. I was skeptical at first but it's performance surprised me. Battery lasts a decent amount of time and connects beautifully into the Amazon ecosystem I already am in. Would recommend to anyone who likes to watch videos/browse the web on the go or for children. Best buy was very helpful & the tablet is good for reading books & basic serfing This is a perfect size and weight. Everything is very clear, sharp and large enough to be comfortably readable. Word has it that relationships are interrupted by electronic devices. Well my girl takes her reader everywhere we go. She used to tell me I talk to much. Now I can hardly get a word in edgewise! This is smaller and lighter than my previous fire and works even better It's not a $400.00 tablet so what can you expect, except that it does what it's suppose to. It's faster than I thought it would be so thats killer. Everything I expected with none of the drawbacks I have found in other tablets Great tablet. No problems at all. Excellent Price. the only downside of it is that you can't have google playstore on this tablet but you can still install it manually since they both based on android os Great for those who love to read this tablet is always ready for on the go trips I only have an older ipad to compare this to, but there is literally no comparison. The Fire 8\" tablet is lightweight, connects ultra fast to wifi, has an easy-to-follow automatic set up, and comes with tons of features that I'm only beginning to explore. I wasn't expecting this at all! I'm a total convert especially because the price is so reasonable, too. Super fast. Lots of storage. Great tablet for anyone. bought as a gift for Christmas. they love it!!!!!! This is an upgrade tablet from my first Kindle Fire that I purchased 5 years ago. Love the larger screen the quick processing and downloads, the great HD visuals, and most importantly all of my previous pictures and music files were easily transferred/accessed by this new device. Love that this Fire has a front and rear camer too, my old Fire only had a front facing camera. Granted this is not an iPad, but I don't want or need all an iPad does. And I definitely don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just because it is cool. My Fire tablet does everything I need or want and it costed under $99.00. I am one satisfied and pleased customer. very easy to use I live my fire the best purchase I have made in months Purchased this to get a lighter tablet. Also to update our my old tablet which had a replaceable battery. This is all around lighter ,thinner and easier to handle. HD is a good upgrade and can't beat the price for comparable tablets with same features. my wife reads on it daily and loves it. I am probably going to search for another one.We have the 8\" and I would like to try a 7\" if it were available.I like to try different size devices to see how I adjust same way with todays phones. The size of the Fire tablet gives you the feel of having a book in your hands while reading a book. Because of the size and lightweight it's easy to transport and fits easily in my purse. I'm enjoying my Fire tablet which was a gift. The tablet is Excellent! Very fast and well worth the money! The display is great! I got this for my kid as a gift so he could read books easier and it has helped a ton! I got an 8\" windows tablet for my father in law and we quickly realized that windows is not a good choice for someone that is not already comfortable with all the windows features that are not tablet friendly. This tablet on the other hand, had a very easy learning curve and my father in law became comfortable with all the features in a couple of hours. I would definitely recommend it as a gift. The 8 inch Amazon Fire 6th edition is by the far the best tablet in the Amazon market. The 7-inch is a nice size, but the 8-inch has better screen resolution and longer battery life. If you are an Amazon Prime member, this is a must have tablet. Also, the Amazon magnetic case does a great job in protection and sleek-ness. Great tablet for my childthis tablet was just everything that I need it for my child Very easy to use and small enough to travel with. I slide it right into my bag. I would recommend this ereader above all others for its high quality and diversity. Not only as an ereader but as a web browser. I love my new Kindle Fire even more than my old one which I lost. Perfect for a kid and it was cheap! My son has broke a lot of tablets, this one seems durable. I travel a lot and this is perfect for watching movies or reading on the flights The Kindle is great! It's easy to set up and I've found all the books that I wanted. Great tab and the price cannot be beat, Only gripe is the fire os. Oh well This tablet is great for the price. It has good connection to wi if. The kindle store is a breeze. The picture quality is good. And seems to be the perfect size. A nice alternative compared to The more expensive tablet. And much better quality then the less expensive tablets I would recommend I bought two Kindle Fires for my 4 year old twin grandsons this past Christmas. We downloaded lots of educational programs for them and they absolutely love it! No need to buy them an IPAD which was far more costly! My granddaughter love this fire for al her games. We also downloaded a music app for her and she is so happy with this. So many things she will learn how to do on this tablet. Bought a Kindle Fire for my wife several years ago, our son is now 9 and he had kind of taken over the tablet from my wife. So we decided he was responsible enough and bought this for him for Christmas. I cannot believe the improvement over the previous Kindle Fire we own. The screen is more clear and bright and even seems more detailed, apps load faster, it connects to the internet faster. For the $89.99 they currently sell for I would say it is an excellent value. If you can wait, we paid less at Christmas so a lower price could be seen again. This was a great purchase! Love the fact I can download TV or movies and watch off-line. Easy set up. I bought the first edition kindle fire years ago. My kids loved it so much that I bought this product to replace the old one. They love this one even more. Larger screen and more memory, you can't go wrong! Gift for my grandpa so he can do internet searches from his chair and play games. He loved it. It's simple to use and inexpensive I love my kindle fire it's is good for watching movies reading and anything you need a tablet for. I bought this kindle fire for my teenage son so he could use it at school and play games on the kindle, he loves it. This tablet is small enough to pack but the screen is the perfect size for watching movies on the plane when traveling. I highly recommend kindles. I wouldn't own anything else. I love reading and this is the best device yet not only for reading. This has wifi capabilities. I would highly recommend this item. I had Microsoft Surface, unfortunately daughter dropped and cracked screen so needed a new tablet. Since went back to laptop for work didn't need another Surface. Settled on 8\" Kindle HD over Samsung and IPad mini due to value. I only use for social networks, email, games, internet search, and occasional viewing of videos. This is a good basic tablet that can handle this no problem with a good wifi connection. Great value as I paid under $100 during the holidays and it has been as good as my Surface for these basic uses. I recently upgraded to this model of Kindle. Liked it so much I bought this one for my daughter. She loves it. It's much nicer than the older model she and I had. I had a very early generation Kindle that I loved. I was unwilling to update my Kindle because it was so great. The new one I got from my wife made it look like the old one was standing still. It's much faster and I love it. I love this tablet because of its user friendly interface. It reminds me of a starter tablet for kids, without being too much of a dull product. Nice handheld size. Clear text. Easy to read books on. Bought this for my daughter to use in school, she loves it! Product works great! I also bought the older version for my mom and she lives it as well I would like to say this is my best tablet I have ever buy till now. I will rate it more then iPad Mini. Its best with battery, wifi, touchscreen, sound etc. I had other tablet for my kids earlier, but after having fire hd8, I will not recommend or like to go for any other brand in future. You can't get such good quality product in such less price. I am really very happy on my right decision to choose fire hd8 for my family and kids. Love the access to films. Easy to read and work with. A Little like an Android. I am used to IPhone apps but this works great once you understand it. Broke the screen on our 2nd gen fire so this is it's replacement. Easy setup, Much faster than older one. Just the right size for games, email, social media. Great and informative service. The guy who helped us was very friendly. Love the Fire, the picture is good and really like the amazon link I have an LG tablet but picked up this one for my Dad and after messing with it for a while it's very nice,. I think I like it more the my LG g pad! Better then the older models bigger and better then before I really enjoy my amazon. It is getting easyer to use and I am finding new apps every day. This tablet is awesome...HD resolution, fast processor and affordable! Highly Recommended. Nice tablet. Very speedy. The only thing I don't like is that I can't add GooglePlay apps to it. At only $69.00 I guess that's to be expected. I use my kindle on a daily basis. It is a good size for reading in bed. My son totally loves it! The size is just right, and it is pretty fast. I don't have any complaints about it. On Christmas Eve I went in looking for an iPad as a gift. They were sold out and I was directed to the Amazon Fire HD8. The picture quality is amazing (hence the HD). I watched a movie on it and the picture was better than my HD tv. I have to say, I would buy this tablet over an iPad any day...AND it cost less than a fourth of the price! I am extremely pleased. Fast. Efficient. Reliable. Purchased to watch movies. Quality is great. Sound from tablet needs work but earphone is usually used or at least recommended for personal use. My son loves his kindle fire. He uses it every day. The Amazon Fire HD8 tablet is a high quality, inexpensive piece of technology that works great for anyone looking to purchase one that won't break the bank. Bought for someone not tech savvy and he's done great Wasn't happy with first one I opened as Christmas gift, it didn't work from right out of the box. Contacted Amazon and they sent a new one the next day. This one has worked from the get go. I'm now enjoying my new tablet. Very happy with Amazons service and prompt response to the issue. Love Alexa and all of its features. Love that I can listen to music and read ebooks Paid $60 for it on sale during holidays, couldn't ask for better product for the price Bought this for each of my grandchildren and they loved it. Very user friendly Great value from Best Buy. Bought at Christmas sale. great tablet well worth the price which was a deal on black friday Original Kindle Fire would finally no longer charge so bought this to replace. Not quite the quality of original (not as fast, resolution not as good) but can't complain for the price. Good choice for casual web surfing and reading. I bought this for my 3yr old son and it's perfect for him! With a mixture of games (kid friendly) and read-along books makes it a perfect for the kids and of course there's so much more for adults as well.. great buy! Great tablet, especially for the price. I bought this to replace an old Fire 7 tablet, that I had the battery going down. It works nicely and I love the Kindle Freetime and the parental control settings. I bought this for my niece and she really enjoyed it. She was able to watch Netflix on it and play games. She could surf the internet if she needed to. We went with the bigger GB since it wasn't much more. Gave it as a door prize at office party. They love it. This tablet is simple to set up and it's worth the price. It's perfect for beginners. Great tablet for easy operation. Was a great upgrade for a family member. My 2nd Fire. Great picture quality. Easy to use. Would recommend for all ages. I bought this to take on cruise to read and listen to music... less expensive than my tablet, so if I loose it not as big a loss... it does all I thought it would..easy to set up... to get the most from this tablet you should be an amazon prime member $100 a year, not required,but lots of benefits from it OK its not an iPad, but it is a very good tablet for less than 100 dollars.My only complaint is that it don't have a true GPS chip and relies on your WiFi reported location for apps and therefore some apps cannot be loaded on this device that rely on a true GPS. But it is a great travel tablet and with an SD card you can download your Amazon or other content and watch offline. A great travel tablet! For the price you get alot of valueGreat for watching movies amazon shopping youtube This product met all of our my needs and I would recommend it to others. I have the HD 7 and an HDX 7, and the 8 outperforms them both. If you are an Amazon fan of the eco system, this is a must. The screen is bright and crisp. The processor performs very well with the latest software update. I love it. Bought to use for recent travel. Was able to download several movies and TV shows from Netflix. Seems to have decent storage. Video playback was fine. Easy to set up and use. Nice graphics and lots of apps to choose. I got this for my husband who is technology challenged and so far, he's using it without getting frustrated, which is huge! love the first now a new one. everything at your fingertips. purchased for a little guy, and i am very pleased with it!! This is actually a pretty good little tablet. It is not the most powerful and it doesn't have the highest resolution screen. But for the price, you can't go wrong. It does what it is supposed to do and for the low price you won't feel much pain if you break it. A perfect first tablet for the kids or a nice secondary tablet that you can just toss in a bag or the car for road trips. Amazon Fire tablets are the best products in their price ranges, especially if they are on sale as they were at the last Black Friday event. Excellent purchase. This tablet is the best one we've ever bought. And, the least expensive! It satisfies all of our needs; email, Facebook, Candy Crush, YouTube, Bluetooth broadcasting to a remote speaker. We love it. No frustration whey using the keyboard or finger clicking on icons or commands! i was surprised buy how light and compact this was but still strong enough to do what i needed. For the price, you can't beat this tablet. It is fast and basic. I had problems with my White page and was in the process of buying ad new Kindle I found this was a better unit for my use than tine White-page. Perfect for the price. It is great to bring with you on the go. And like I said can't beat the price. The only con is it has a plastic back so be careful. The battery is great. I would absolutely recommend this product. Gave this to my wife for Christmas. Upgraded from the original Kindle. She thoroughly enjoys it. Fire is a good tablet. Portable size . Have bought a couple for gifts as well This tablet is really easy to use and since I'm a Amazon Prime member the video's and music is easy to access. I'm really surprised how fast the unit compared to my older i-pad. I would recommend this if anyone wants a good value product. This is a great tablet for the money. Perfect for someone who does not want to shell out hundreds for an iPad. like a tablet. great, fast connection. everything I wanted in an electronic reader. I bought this for my mom and she loves it. She said it is really easy to use and loves the lighting, it's easy for her to read. This tablet is so great for the price, but Amazon has always put out excellent product. This is fairly lightweight and pretty fast too. Like all Amazon product it ties all your Amazon accounts so downloads and purchases are super easy. I have dropped it a couple of times and no damage... so it's pretty tough too. It is a great and affordable tablet for my 12 & 13 year old grandsons. It keeps up with the higher speed internet. So far the tablet works great. I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she downloads games no problem. The 16gb is great I'm glad I purchased the larger storage capacity. I like that it gets 12 hours of charge time. Easy to use. i bought this on a whim because my brother recommended i try it sometimes. hard to believe how important this is in my life. this has opened up my long forgotten youth with music and videos anytime Basic internet plus a ton of Amazon apps and some standard ones too. If you want to use Amazon it is an excellent tool. Really enjoy this product. Love watching movies and playing games on my Fire HD 8 Great rablet, clear screen and small design. Great for watching movies. Great for keeping around the house and doing basic Internet functions. For traveling it lets you bring books, movies and/or tv shows via Amazon so being Amazon Prime is a plus.For you business travelers, out of the box it can open, view, & edit MS Office files, .docx, .xlsx, & .pptx.All this for 25% the price of a iPad. Yes, the iPad can do more, but do you need it? I pulled the trigger on the fire tablet knowing the I would have to install the google play store separately. with some work this could be the most bang for your buck for an android tablet. Purchased for my niece for a Christmas gift. She loves it no complaints Best tablet money can buy for under 100$. Very happy with its performance and responsiveness. External speaker is much better on this than my more expensive samsung tab E tablet. Got this tablet on sale for $59.99 at Best Buy and got Webroot Internet Security free with purchase. This is not a high end tablet but it works really great for many of the things I do. For the price it can't be beat! Easy to use and portable. Took on vacation and it was great to kkep up on emails and news. Really handy. Can check email, read a book. Also can access info on the web. Lightweight. Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. She is an avid reader. She previously had a B&N Nook which stopped working. This is much nicer and she loves it. Would recommend for someone who likes to read while traveling or simply at home. Bought this tablet for a child at Christmas. After days of research, this tablet seemed to be the best buy of the lot. It had a good processor, decent memory, and good reviews. It should be exactly what a 12 year old would need in a tablet at a great price. Great easy tablet for a reasonable price. Not the most super powerful. It can get the job done for simple tasks such as surfing the web, checking email, playing YouTube, etc. screen is clear and responsive. Great inexpensive tablet It replaces my 6\" Fire Kindle. Love the HD quality. Owned a kindle fire HDX for GameCircle years. Finally decided Goodreads upgrade. This fire HD 8 is great. Really Prime the larger screen and new features.

If you have Amazon Prime this is the tablet for you as it gives you access to unlimited, music, movies, and tv. Awesome purchase! Great size and storage for reading my online books My grandson loved it. I had the smaller one but wanted to larger one for him. I received this as a gift. One of the best I've ever received. I bought two of these Fire Tablets for gifts for my sons. They are both thrilled with the features. They use them for gaming, music, photo albums, emails and online activities. The HD is what sold me. I have a Kindle Fire 2nd generation and I enjoyed mine so much since 2012, I looked into getting this one. I gave my husband this tablet for Christmas.

Second one, bigger, better, easy as pie to set up. bought two for the family and they connect easily and work surprisingly fast for a small price. We bought this to replace my children's aging Ipads and they're very happy. I was looking for a easy to use tablet for a beginner and this met my needs . The Kindle Fire HD is an impressive Product. It is faster than my Samsung tablet. I know I will enjoy using it. I just wish that Amazon Prime music had a downloadable app for it. Downloading is a breeze, works quick and effective for what I bought it for. Very pleased. if you had a kindle fire 1st. this one is mush better.with all the new stuff inside . I bought two of these for the grandkids, I was going to show them how to set them up, didn't need to! ilovemy kindle 8\" . However it has crash a couple of times and am not sure why. also the 8\" case is not made for this kindle because the clamps used to hold it are right on the buttons to turn on and volume. so if you have a better case for it please let me know. Works very well. Cheaper than an iPad and works great for apps and video. This was so easy to set up and the print can easily be adjusted to extra large. My 78 year old dad was really happy with his first experience with technology. He is now surfing the net and reading news online. Highly recommended. I got 2 of these for my 8 and 9 year old daughters and I love them and so do they LOVE BEING ABLE TO MAKE SPECIFIC PROFILES FOR MY CHILDREN We love the kindle fire HD8. it can have various profiles to accomodate all people who uses it in our family household. it is also very easy to set up Bought this Kindle because of the great price. Good thing, because I dropped the other one without the case on it and it cracked. I purchased this as alight weight replacement for my laptop. It has accomplished everything I needed. I'm sure there will be something's I still need HP for, but this is a great tablet for what I needed. I got a case and 64gig card also. Everything works seamlessly so far. I upgraded my mother's 3rd generation Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7\" to this new one and she likes the display being bigger to 8\" and is much faster. My husband bought this on Black Friday at a really great price! He loves how lightweight this is, and offers him his email, internet functionality and books, of course. Great buy! This fire is much better than the old one so far. It responds much faster and has a much better screen. I also put a 128 gig memory stick into it which the old fire could not accommodate. So far, so good. This was purchased an a reward for a job well done. Set up was easy and the functionality was perfect for my needs. I found this to be a great tablet for all ages-easy to use-great content. You cannot get a better tablet for the price and Best Buy had it on sale. Daughter loves it. Everything transferred from her Kindle to the fire. She said it is unbelievable fast. This version is a really good upgrade over the older fire tablet that we had before. Very happy with it. It is awesome play pokemon and clash use silk its awesome great present I bought as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old and she loves it. It works great and my package arrived early with no issues. I purchased this item for my son as a Christmas gift. His eyes lit up as he unwrapped it on Christmas morning. Later in the day, his older cousin had to call me and verify if he had truely received this item as a Christmas gift... I also plan on taking Best Buy up on their e - mailed offer that I received, which states that I can receive free start up service to get me started with my tech purchase. One of the best tablets on the market for its value Strong fast tablet. My 8 year old can manage it perfectly! Does what I wanted it to do. Really like the way it performs. I purchased this for my wife so that she has an option other than her phone or laptop to browse the internet. I Love this tablet its Awesome and way Cool I highly recommend this to anyone Great price Inexpensive, No need to worry about it getting broken/lost It is very handy great when i don't want to use a computer and i can take it anywhere Bought it for my wife and the fire does not have to be recharged as often as the paper white. she likes it I started with the 7\" little brother and liked it a lot, so I decided to upgrade to the larger model. I use it primarily as an e-reader and for some net surfing and Facebook. The WiFi works great and is ready to access and use. Don't buy this unit if you want cell (4g) access to the Internet. It is WiFi only. Frankly, my cell phone takes better pictures, but that's not what I really wanted from the unit. All in all, a great reader with excellent battery life. Great gift idea. Nice addition to the kindle family. So far it does what I want. Very happy with the price too. I read the reviews, before I purchased this item and.... So far, so GOOD! The handy-dandy case that I found on sale for 9.99, at the same time works well too. Everything I needed it for. Screen is nice enough and price was right. Perfect for my wife and college daughter. Very easyTo learn reader. Very pleased with my tablet. Love that it's HD and user friendly. I thought twice about getting this because of people saying you have limited apps but its not to limited so I am very happy. I was able to get google youtube Netflix and all the main apps I actually care about. For the price you cannot do any better. Love it so much we ended up getting my kids each one. Key to owning this tablet is having amazon prime account Easy to use and navigate. Great for watching movies and videos!! Bought two of these for my kids for Christmas. Love the level of control it gives me to supervise and monitor usage. Best deal I have seen online. I checked Amazon and they were not as good. Great battery life and picture quality. The camera is not the greatest but I often don't use it for the camera. I usually have my phone with me so I use that instead. Can hold a lot of books too. I bought 3 three of these for my boys for Christmas gifts. Great little tablet. Perfect for everything they want to use it for. Greatest small tablet. Just wanted something convenient. My wife loves her Fire Hd8 she had one of the older models so i up graded her to this new model and she feel in love with it right away We got 2 of these tablets in black Friday for a great price! its a pro if you have amazon prime, since everything around this tablet is amazon base- shopping, videos, books, and alexa. Always a good price and good for what it's meant for. Amazon Fire is great for reading my Kindle Books, checking email, facebook, or checking out the internet. Haven't ck'd out what else I can do with it, but I'm sure there is a lot. Love the Amazon Fire HD tablet, easy to get around Download games, movies, education apps to help ur kids to learn to read do math problems and keep them entertained while on the road or family trips These are excellent to keep on the coffee table or taking along on a trip. Can't beat the price. Definitely worth the investment...I may get a couple of more! My daughter had a smaller eight GB tablet ... this was a nice step up for her and with better graphics. We extended the memory with an SD card for photos. Love this Kindle. It is my fourth kindle and it is best one yet. I have had many tablets, Samsung, Asus and old Ipad. This Fire holds its own . The Silk system is not quite as speedy but the lack of bloatware is nice. There is a hack to get more google apps. It's light to hold, the ads are not invasive. I enjoy taking advantage of the Prime benefits. Simple to operate. Would recommend for everyday use and movie/reading music consumption. Christmas gifts for 2 granddaughters. They loved there first ones. time for a update There are better tablets, but at this price point the Fire HD 8 is outstanding. Reasonably priced and great for the grandkids. We purchased cheaper tablets for them last year and none of them lasted! So far these are looking 100% better. This baby is a bargain. Very good screen, decent overall quality and performance...and now Alexa. I use it with Bluetooth speaker and it has become my office music machine. Hold the home button and ask Alexa to play easy jazz. No muss; no fuss. Improves upon 'regular' Alexa because she has a screen now!. I got exactly what I was expecting with this purchase, a low cost device for media consumption (e-books, movies, music) with surprisingly decent performance in the few games I've tried on the device. The MicroSD expansion card slot is a must-have for me when purchasing any tablet device. Most people will go with a bigger more sofisticated iPad or Samsung but this is a good product for a child to pass time or someone not wanting all the bells and whistles Perfect cheap device for kids and grandkids nice to have sitting around This Fire HD 8 is my first such device. I find it to be easy to operate and very responsive.The touch screen control takes getting used to as I often click on the wrong close part of the screen and have to go back. The Alexa voice assistant surprised me when she announcedherself over the speaker. (I shut her off since I'm not a fan of conversing with computers).My main complaint is that comes with nothing but a charger and cable. The wordless, pictorialstart up instructions were primitive and vague. There are no instructions on how to use thisdevice; no sample book to test and get familiar with. There is a help function thatfills in some basics of functionality but not thorough enough. The WiFi connectivity is great, using the latest protocol and encryption. It has a simple web browser but web time also seems to be the greatest drain on the battery. The cable can be used toattach to a Windows PC and transfer files (books, music, pictures etc). I would also recommend buying a protective case for if its ever accidently dropped. This Fire tablet is a nice upgrade to the one I purchased 3 years ago. The screen is great, it is very fast, has lots of storage with the SD card, and just an all-around good product. And a great value. This tablet is an easy device to download sites and convenient too! Purchased the 8 inch Fire tablet during Black Friday and have been using it since. A great deal. Doesn't disappoint. Nice features. Owned two prior to this one. Very nice tablet. This is my first tablet and I'm excited about learning how to use it. I have not used it a ton yet but I am very happy with my experience so far. This is great for an 8 yr old. She had out grown her Nabi and likes taking pictures this does just the trick. The memory can be extended to hold more pictures. Great tablet. I started out with an original kindle and wanted one with backlight and the price was too good to pass up! I LOVE my fire! I subscribe to both Amazon Prime and Netflix, and it's perfect for those. Plus you can add additional memory cards. I have bought iPads for everyone in my house, and bought this for myself and am in heaven. The camera isn't good though, but I don't use it. For the money, this is an incredible value. Black Friday deal. Great alternative for my 2 IPads. This Kindle fire is amazing. I love how kindlely and fiery it is. Great value for such a well made tablet. Everything you need for a low price Loved the Fire HD7 but the latest HD8 is sharper, faster and still handles great. Easy to use tablet. Good price. Great for beginners as well as intermediate users. Fun! Great product simple easy to understand great value!!!! Great price and good quality screen image in a nice 8\" format. I installed a 128 GB microSD card with no problems. I was impressed with the quality of the device and it fit a generic tablet cover that was too big for the 7\" generic tablet I had previously purchased. I wished I had gotten a few more during the black Friday sale. It came with a charger and cable. Great tablet/e-reader. You can do a lot on this bad boy!! Great all around Tablet. Does a little bit of everything along with being the best e-reader around. Great quality and decent price. Love features and the fact that I can mirror my tablet on my tv with firestick. Perfect for teenage tablet, perfect for homework!! This tablet is well worth the money. It has descent performance and good screen resolution. And it is definitely a great tablet for beginners. This is the one for those who don't want to spend more on tablets. Really great product. It's pretty good! Did what I needed? I love this tablet. It does pretty much every thing my ipad does!!!! My mom had been wanting one for a while, so this was great. Great budget tablet. Just needs good sized microsd card! I\" like it a lot, easy to use , A big improvement over the original, the price was increideble (black friday special)onclude a camera , front and rear, the quality is not as good as a cell phone, but is ok No complaints. I just wish it played .avi, but that is not really a huge problem I purchased this kindle on black friday for $60.it works very well as a reader and tablet. It has good battery life and silk is a decent option for a browser. I also side loaded the nook apponto this kindle. It works as well here as it does on my nookereader. Has all of the functions of the expensive iPads and works great for fraction of the cost!!! After looking at several similar products, and looking at multiple reviews, the Amazon Fire HD 8 seemed like the best choice. The fact that it was on-sale one-third off on Black Friday made the final choice easy. We are very pleased with how this product works and how it met our needs for a bit larger screen. Easy for us mid-seventy year-olds to use. Upgraded my tablet to hd, previous owned the 7\" regular. I wanted a tablet so my grandkids can use instead of using my ipad. A great xmas gift. Very user friendly and straight forward instructions great for all ages I had a smaller version and this was easy to adjust to and use. Really affordable present for a kid.. Or just have around It's a great tablet for the price. Fast and snappy Upgrade to my kindle fire 7, pleased with all the new features including Alexa I enjoy my Kindle immensely, so much better than having to start up my computer. Bought on Black Friday for my kids, my 3 year old can work it just fine with the kids app for watching YouTube and other videos. I picked this up as a doorbuster for my father-in-law. He has an Amazon account and can watch the movies he likes. My kids like it very much! The price is low. The tablet is light weighted. I am very satisfied with this tablet. I use it for browsing because the screen is larger than my phone. Caught it on sale and bought two. Good value for the money. It was recommended by a friend. Get a case for it, it is easier to hold on to. The second one will make a nice gift. Got this thing around Black Friday and only paid about 50 something bucks. Awesome equipment you can actually stream the web very glad I bought it can't believe it so inexpensive! This was a gift for one of my granddaughters. She just loves this Kindle. This is the second one I've bought for her. This is a bigger and newer generation with lots more options. Fun to use and also easy for kids to use as well! Good tablet for books and games for all the family! Great tablet, perfect size, has night mode on display so you would be able to fall asleep if using at night - won't keep you awake because blue light is filtered out. Response is great, colors IPS panel great, no blue tooth It's a really great tablet. It even has Amazon Alexa built in, so I don't have to buy Echo or Echo Dot. I originally bought it to use as a MP3 player but has so many features, I haven't added any music to it. Very good for kids to learn and play games and research school work. Purchased these for my grandkids...and they absolutely love them. They can play play their games to their hearts' content. They ar ed really fast too. Great tablet for kids to use! Play games or read books and isn't slow. I got this kindle because I broke my Fire 7'. It took some getting use to since the screen was bigger but overall it was a great purchase. I love my new kindle fire HD8!!! It is a great tablet for all ages and easy to navigate!!!! I highly recommend this tablet for everyone!! Used for internet surfing . Does a great job, it's great! Perfect price for the tablet and recommend for kids who don't take care of electronics. Purchased a I-Pad and the kids broke it and was out $600.00. If they break the tablet I can purchase another on at the low cost at Best Buy. This tablet is really good for the price, especially on the holidays. If you are a movie watcher or just using it for games it has great speed with a quad core. Highly recommend so e-book as well. Very happy with my purchase I bought 3 already. My amazon fire is amazing, it is fast and is durable. Great table I pay cheap price is gift for my son my son is happy My daughter loves this tablet. Uses it for Netflix! So impressed with the battery life on this! My phone's battery is almost dead in the morning, but this thing can play music for 8 hours and the battery just goes down 20%. :) I am glad that I made this choice for both my kids: they love this gadget it has things for them to learn and play. Great thing about this is customized content for children The Amazon tablet line is possibly one of the best our there. The functionalities of android and windows with the ease of use equal to an Ipad Tmtis is the second tablet I purchased for my kids. Its perfect for all the things my kids do. I love how you can keep up with social media and watch movies online. This is fantastic!!! My wife loves reading on the tablet. It's also great for surfing the web. needed a tv in our kitchen, wasn't looking for huge or fancy for this. so the 32 inch was perfect for us Works great. Easy conversion for an aging guy without much technological experience. I bought my Fire HD just for reading. I have a Kindle Unlimited membership and wanted to keep all my books in one place. This is an amazing little tablet. How Amazon can sell these for only $89 is beyond me. And I got mine on Black Friday, so it was only $59! At that price it was a downright steal. I had the first Kindle Fire. This model is better in every way imaginable. I also own an iPad Pro 9.7\". I don't try to compare the Fire with the iPad, they are completely different devices. But for what the Fire is, I love it every bit as much as I love my Pro! I bought this as an upgrade from my old Kindle. Works awesome, i can even watch movies through my Amazon Prime. Plenty of apps to choose from. Awesome little tablet. Great beginner tablet for all ages. Easy to use by all ages. Bought this for our 8 year old for Christmas. Looks like he's going to love it! Bought this for my niece for Christmas. I'm sure she will love it! I was pretty impressed with this little device. It was easy to setup and works rather well. I had also bought a IPad Air 2 with 128GB during BF for $375. After playing around with the HD Fire I returned the Air 2 because it met my needs at a much lower price. I added a 64GB SD card and am downloading movies from Netflix. The HD display is very clear. Battery life could be a little better but overall I'm very satisfied with it. The free stuff you get with an Amazon Prime account is icing on the cake. I dig it! Easy to set up. Perfect size. Easy to read font. Price was affordable. Great gift idea for the adults on my Christmas list. Nice size tablet. Very easy to use. Love it!!!!! Beats my laptop. This tablet is the best you can buy for the money. Great apps, great picture.

Live the endless library of downloadable books. If you're looking for a tablet to read books & surf the Internet, this is perfect. awesome, great value, good quality product, I would recommend this to anyone Gift for my mom and she absolutely loves it. It was exactly what she wanted. The Amazon Fire HD8 is a super fast tablet for the money. When combined with an Amazon Prime account the true value is released. We purchased tablets for nearly every family member and linked them all through one Amazon account. This becomes an unbelievable value. This was a perfect gift for the holidays! I saw the reviews on this and immediately had to get it! I bought this on Black Friday and I have been using it for about a month. It is faster than my Fire 7 2015 most likely due to the 1.5GB vs 1GB RAM. The screen resolution is fine though not the best. At this price I am not complaining. Amazon adds some nice features as well. The advertisements are discreet and only when the fire is turned on. Not a problem at all. Even at full price this is a good deal. I bought this tablet for my 7 years old and love it. Great parental control, set up goals for the day, turns off at the time, I decided. Works perfectly and very fast processor We got a great deal on Fire HD 8. My kids love playing on it. I use most of Amazon services (Prime, Kindle, Music, Video, Alexa) and this is the best companion to access all services seamlessly. This tablet also has great features/expansion and performance. I just like reading amd playing games on it..Better then those bulky computers I have an Amazon fire tablet and love it so hopefully he will also. Pretty easy to use as your first tablet. I'm loving my kindle. Early gift to myself. Happy! its the best tablet that you can buy for the price and you can add a memory card to it. The new Fire HD8 tablet is a great purchase for the price; it's fast enough for basic browsing, and you can download prime videos to watch on the go (which is why I bought it). We use them for classes, they work great and are easy to use for our older individuals does everything our other tablets do and more. Like the sharing across platforms. Purchased this for my mother. She loves it, just the right size to grab and go. Great buy for the money. I read the online reviews and compared products. Same price here as on Amazon. This is a great product. Very inexpensive and a great gift for children. The gift was great since I have a 10 I knew was a good present for a very deserved person! Good speed compared to the other models just the size and weighs very little. Large viewing area for a 8\" tablet HD I was a ook user and have been converted to kindle. The size is great and it is very responsive. Got one for me and one as a gift. I expect my tablet to be a workhorse. Available to have two or three books open that I'm reading, hanging on to my email and ready with summaries of the news. The new Kindle Fire does it on a larger, brighter page. It is a work horse more than worth the money.. It goes with me might and day. I don't know what I'd without this gem. My nephew is 3 years old and this is a great starter tablet. He is gonna be so excited Christmas morning. I replaced my old kindle as it took a power failure hit. The new kindle has been updated and it is easier to download the e-books. I am learning some of the new updates but it appears to be more user friendly than my old one. Customer Service for the Kindle is available 24/7 and they are very helpful. You can get a review about any book before you purchase it. No returning books to the library. This is a new tab upgrade for me as I have had my previous Kindle for over 7 years and love it. Have been very pleased with all aspects of the Fire HD8. Good performance for the low price. This was a gift for my wife. She loves it. She uses it everyday. Holds a great charge.

My old tablet stopped working so the value of the Amazon Fire at Best Buy was too much to pass up Bought as a gift for my daughter. and s he loves it. I was reluctant to replace my previous Kindle Fire because I wasn't sure I would like it as well. I am pleased to say I'm loving it! I bought Kindle fire for my grandson who is 24. I have one and he thought great can do so much on it. For the price you can't beat it. I use more then computer. Use it for what it is necessary. That is all I need. Great Tablet for occasional users who want to Watch Movies, Read books, and browse the web. I already own one but bought another for my sister in law for Christmas. Works better than what I expected. Able to surf the net and watch movies. The battery life and screen are awesome. Bought this for under 60 bucks and looking to buy more to give as a gift I purchased the Fire Tablet to temporarily replace an iPad and an LG tablet that were destroyed. My 7-year-old won't put it down--he can play all his favorite games, read Kindle books, and watch YouTube videos (as long as he has wi-fi access). It's holding up well. Good price. I bought this for my wife. She had a Barnes and Noble Nook, this took it's place. She uses the Kindle Fire daily from reading books and playing games to looking up things on the web. She lives it. The Amazon fire hd 8 is great.

Recommend it is small enough to carry in your purse and open up a whole new world while waiting at appointments. Looks pretty solid will update review as soon as gift is opened . We have one for each of my children so I bought this one for my mother. They are amazing tablets especially for the price! Gift for my mom and she had no problem learning to use.

BOUGHT MINE ON BLACK FRIDAY AND IT IS AWESOME. MY FIRST TABLET AND IT IS GREAT WITH ALL OF THE AMAZON FEATURES. So easy to use and can do so much more than just read on it I received this as a gift after my original Kindle Fire started giving me trouble after 4 1/2 years and wouldn't hold a charge. This new Kindle Fire 8 is fantastic! The larger size makes it easier to read. The \"buttons\" are better than the old one. I like that is has more \"perks\", i.e. camera, that my old one didn't have. It's nice to be able to read, play games, browse the internet, or check email or take photos. The battery lasts for days! I definitely recommend this.

As well as play games. He loves it and his parents are pleased with his eagerness to read. Was told by sales person I could come back in a week with receipt to get $30 off (Black Friday price). Customer service lady said they don't do that. I was misled. Item itself is okay. Great Kindle, my wife had the originally one and this one is better in every way. I purchased this tablet on thanksgiving day when I was already in the store buying a new cell phone. It was on sale $59. I am very pleased with my purchase. I am already an Amazon prime member so it links up to my account.

I am now thinking on buying one for my four year old nephew as a Christmas present, I only need to buy a sleeve. This is a great gift for my 6 year old nephew. He will enjoy it for hours. Clear screen, color and size, grandson loves to play games on it and I like to have it with me to view emails during commercials while watching tv. I need a table that had more memory to start with. This fit the bill. I had a kindle before but mine did not have a camera like this one . This make it easier to capture picture instead of having to stop and use my phone. Pros: 5 Ghz wifi, supports expansion cardsCons: app store a little limited though there is apparently a workaround Other: the ads fed from Amazon are not terribly intrusiveOverall, the tablet seems to work well and is a good value, Bought for my mom, shes in love with it. Use for netflix myself love the 8' great size and cpu speed. Love my new kindle bought it to replace a 7 inch and I love it. Love my Kindle. It has taken over the place of my laptop completely with all other added benefits. Works great even in OK network areas. Long battery life and easy to use. Would definitely recommend to a friend. I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. I own one as well and I love it. First time with a tablet, wanted one for years just to watch Netflix and basic games. Very happy, the screen looks great and the speaker is loud. So far, so good! The amazon fire HD is great choice for a beginner or not so tech savy person! I like the low light mode the extra memory and a great price compared to the others Best bang for your buck............................ Excellent pick up during the Black Friday Sales. Not too big not to small. This tablet bundled up with Amazon Prime service is a great combo of inexpensive entertainment. Works very well for light tablet use and great for reading. Fire 8 HD 2016 is great. Very easy to maneuver. Easy to use and transition from original Kindle Fire. Much more versatile than the original. Really glad I upgraded. I bought this item for my nephew and he loves it. I have the old version of the fire hd and I love it as well. It's way cheaper than buying an apple tablet. We haven't had any problems with it. Well worth your money Bought it for my daughter and she can't put it down. Great for nextflix I had a kindle for about 4 years, I've been wanting a fire hd for sometimes, because of all the features. I can honestly say that I love my fire hd. Working great as a first tablet for my grandson. He loves it Very fast tablet. Large screen but can held by 1 hand. Great for movies and videos, as well as candy crush and other resource hogging apps. It starts CC way faster than my LG G3 phone. The display is very clear and crisp. The amazon android modified OS is good once you get used to it. I have one screen containing all apps, and you can put these in groups too. so 1 screen is all you will need. then you have the other panels for Amazon mandated stuff like Prime movies, music, pictures. It's pretty cool compared to my previous Acer 8\" tablet with reg Android. Could not easily install Chrome, but I'm getting use to the SILK browser and it will work very well for my needs. Great Tablet and highly recommended. Definitely an amazing deal at an amazing price on Black Friday weekend Amazing product from Amazon within budget and get the best outcome of it It was by far the best deal out there for the money very happy I purchased the Kindle Fire 8\" after owning a 7\" for several years. I love the bigger screen and added features in this version. Bought this for my daughter. It is inexpensive and user friendly. I use it all the time while she's at school. Easy to use and elegant in design. Perfect Gift for Kids. I bought the fire 7 inch last year and this one is better. My wife and kids love it. Easy to use. Great for the price. I bought this on Black Friday for 60 bucks and wasn't expecting too much at that price point. This isn't as good as a iPad but at that price it's pretty close and worth every penny. It is awesome with low price and high quality. My daughters like it very much. Had just the fire like HD better. More movies and better quality. still learning, previously used a nexus7. Like the larger screen. Reading kindle books on it is good too. Makes a great gift. My children love them and never put them down. excellent tablet for this price is wonderfull and great performance Had to buy a new kindle because on my fire hd 7 the battery quit holding a charge. Was told there was nothing you could do. Purchased this for my grandson. It works great and is used mainly for reading and games. Easy to setup with no problems to register and get online. I love this tablet! love my ipad , too, but this is much lighter weight and easier to slip in my purse. I went for a 32g but there were none in stock, so I got the 16 and a memory card that I will probably never need! Love it fast , pictures look fab. love the battery life fast, easy to use, very sensitive, google play store captable, I will buy again Fire tablets never disappoints! Great price, used my certificate points which helpedAlways best price at best but Most of the Kindles I have purchased have been gifts, but this one was for me. It is just what I expected from the reviews. Great tablet for the money. I love the light weight for the size! Fun tablet!!! Inexpensive tablet. Funtional and great for reading. It has the blue screen that make it great for reading. Great graphics for price compared to other brands. Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. I know he will enjoy it. After I read the reviews there are a variety of things he can do on it for a 13 year old. Purchased this for my nephew for Christmas. After reading reviews, I think this will be a good device for reading books and listening to music. Upgraded from a6\" inch Fire HD. For 89.00 I don't think you can find a better tablet value. Resolution is very sharp, audio is good, and it is a good size. My first tablet and it is just perfect for a beginner like me. Easy to use and just the right size. I use it when I just need to check something quickly on the internet without having to turn on my desk top computer. Very fast. great tablet for a great price and size. Would highly recommend ! Great over all Tablet! Good build quality, but cheap enough for the kids to use / loose. Really a plus for travel. Install VLC media player from the amazon app store, and then you have unlimited movie options for up to12 hours. Add some head phones and that 6 hour trip to Disneyland, well it's so much more tranquil for the adults. The screen is a good size (portable but large enough to read) and has excellent resolution and color quality, the wireless connection is good and the user interface is relatively clear and easy to learn. Bought two of these for my grandson and grand daughter and they love them. I like the parental controls and the apps. Perfect device for my kids. Easy to use with lots of features. We had a few other tablets for my wife and all were very poor. We returned two and landed on this one, she has LOVED it, so much more than the others in this price range. I have had two previous kindles since they where first available. I really like all the new upgrades. The screen is very crisp and clean. The color is great. Much easier to look for books. This tablet is great! Nice display, and you get the amazon eco-system. Now you can also download google play easily, so you have the best of both worlds. I was unsure about getting a tablet but after purchasing the Amazon Fire I was convinced that I had made the right choice and have been very happy ever since. I was concerned that I had a lot to learn but it came quickly to me and I really like the screen size. It was a great buy! For the low price it is very speedy and has sufficient storage space.While it doesn't have Google play, the Amazon app store has most of the same apps or a workable alternatve. We are really pleased with this tablet. The color is great. This is a great tablet!!! I absolutely would recommend it to a friend!! I would buy it again!! I enjoy readi,g and Facebook using this item. I also purchased my husband one. It works great for all my needs to check my emails Brought it for my son & Does EXACTLY what i want it to do. Bought this as a replacement for the 7\", faster and better display.... Best upgrade I have been a Kindle Fire user for years. This new one is amazing. I like being able to store information on a SD card. We like the battery endurance. The new 8\" screen is great too. I am very happy with this tablet. It's a good size for me and easy to read and use. I was contemplating to buy either the insignia 10.1 or the Fire Hd8, I'm so glad I chose the latter. It is so fast and sufficient for my needs. I also downloaded Google play on the tablet even making this a better purchase. For $59, you can't go wrong with this purchase. Went in to look at the 10' Kindle Fire and couldn't resist the price on this one. There wasn't a big enough size difference to justify spending more than 200.00 for the 10 inch. This has been a great device so far. Battery life, ease of use, etc I purchased this for my dad as a birthday present. I opened it and set it up for him and it works great. It's fast enough for an Internet browser, and possibly a student. I have been wanting to purchase a tablet for light web browsing, reading, and to watch videos, something easier to carry than my laptop. This tablet is fast & the videos stream in great (as long as you have good Wi-Fi connection). Easy access to Amazon too. Bought this for my father who would have trouble using a computer. He's picking up on it very quickly. It keeps him entertained. Good reliable device. This is a great tablet for kids and adults alike.! Got this for my 3 year old and 7 year old and they love it. I have education apps and books that reads to them or they can read along. I would recommend getting a case for it if it's for the little ones just to keep it protected. impulse purchase but a good one. good fit with amazon account that we already had. nice screen, easy to navigate This suited my exact needs which was a mobile way of watching netflix. I thoroughly enjoy this table! Easy to operate, plenty of memory, and I can use it for anything that I typically use a computer for. Great for airline flights, viewing offline amazon or Netflix shows and reading books. Video quality fine for personal viewing. It has been one of the best purchases ever. It is very simple to use. For me this tablet is an extremely good value! iPads are beautiful things, and they seem to just work really well all the time. But they are expensive! Same thing with Android tablets. You can get a cheap Android tablet, but then you're left with a cheap tablet...poor quality displays, questionable hardware, limited support. I think Amazon hit the spot with their line of Fire Tablets - this HD8 in particular. It's good quality, has a great display, it's quick and snappy, has great battery life. Also being an Android based operating system, there is flexibility like accessing storage, side loading third party apps, even installing Google Play (for those who begrudge the lack of that feature, it can be done). Much more flexibility than you get with an Apple product, at a much lower price than the industry standard Samsung etc. Coming from using Apple products for so long, this thing is really convincing me that there are really viable options other than Apple, and especially for the price, its a great introduction to a different platform. Not only that, it's genuinely a good product! The tablet works great so far. The parent features are nice also. suggested by the sales associate I'm glad I took his suggestion I gave this Amazon Fire HD8 as a retirement gift for my friend and she absolutely loves it!! Bought it for my daughter and she loves it great product at a great price! Easy, fast and efficient.great lil tablet in this price range for anyone. This is a great tablet for the price. I have one that I purchased a few years ago and use it much more than my laptop. Recently purchased two more for gifts. Does the job when I travel and I would recommend to a friend This is my fifth Kindle and with each new one I have a new feature to use. Perfect tablet for my 8 year old without spending a fortune. I love how it has parental controls so I can limit his time playing. Used for reading and surfing the web, this tablet is great for all. Great screen clarity. Purchased the tablet because it was a very reasonable price. It has ended up being a good tablet. I bought this for my mom because she is too scared to even use her laptop. I thought this looked more user friendly since she knows my 5 year old nephew can use an iPad. I purchased several of these tablets during the holidays as gifts. Everyone absolutely loves the FireHD8, especially those with the prime memberships. My only regret is not purchasing one for myself. Great product. Device performed as described. Great reviews. It's easy to use and my son likes to play on it alot I bought this for my 86 year old father. he loves it. finds it very easy to use perfect gift perfect price for my wife to bring her into the technilogical modern world we live in Enjoying the kindle reading watching movies playing games We like it!! Would buy again.Still learning about it's features. Good value Bought it for my 89 year old mom. She has enjoyed reading on it. Easy to use I needed to upgrade from the orginal Kindle fire and this Fire works great. Videos,games, email and battery life all are great. Works as expected. I enjoy reading newspaper articles, books, as well as banking apps and social media tools. I installed a driver for google play store; also I payed amazon to get rid of the lock screen ads ($15). It was worth it. I use this thing alot. Easy to use, great battery life, plenty of space and amazing screen quality. Excellent product. The screen is very easy to read and can access movies, books, and ,more. Was given as a gift to my mother and she loves it. My wife reads a ton, she uses it everyday. She's owned others and this is by far the best. This tablet is hands down the best investment I've ever made. I used to carry a laptop to meetings, then my kids talked me into getting a tablet and what a difference. As long as there is wifi it does everything my laptop will. Hoping for an updated hdx kindle, but settled for this. Enjoy the expanded sd slot. Good cheap tablet. Great for Netflix and YouTube. Screen is a decent size just bigger than a phone and smaller than a laptop. It's also HD which is a plus Purchased to replace the one I bought for my brother in August (physical damage). This time, bought the extended warranty. No issues or claims so far! We are a total Apple family so I was a little hesitant to purchase this when our iPad stopped working. So glad we did because it's perfect and can't beat it for the price! Love using my new tablet (Amazon Fire). Easy to use. Great buy! Good value value for the money & easy to use. Bought this for my dad food Christmas and he loves it. This is a great option for a first tablet. It's lightweight and user friendly. This is just an awesome tablet for the price and the features it has This little thing does everything and does it quickly. It could use a case, so think about getting one, but as an eReader it does everything it is supposed to. I so happy I can recommend this good thanks Best Buy is the number one My 10 year old uses it at school to scan qr codes and do his online math. Santa got this for my 7year old. Work's great . He plays, games, gets on hulu, and can play his school education learning games. Now he doesn't bother me to use my electronic devices . I have always been an iPad user but I love the kindle fire 8.

This tablet is sturdy and great for my kids with games and learning. I love my kindle fire it holds a library of books that I can read anywhere. I change from my kindle fire to my phone if I don't have the kindle with me. So I can start right where I am in the book and then finish up on my kindle fire when I can. I play games and listen to books all on this device. Love it Great for reading e-mail, pictures or viewing internet. Great item, I can say it feel just like working with an iPad. Picture, sound, size and touch are very sweet. this is a great tablet for under $100 and you can add kodi on it, to me thats the best feature and the duel sided camera Got this as a gift for my Mom who reads a ton. She loves it for reading and great portability. Great tablet for the price. I love it a lot and use it daily, bought books.... I got theses tablets for my grandkids for Christmas, they love them. My granddaughter loves her tablet. She has learned how to play both educational and recreational games. Will be very helpful in the future. Great tablet for the price easy set up and app and data transferring from the original Fire. This was purchased for my 9 year-old to play games, watch movies, and read on. When we set it up, I was extremely impressed with the quality that we got for the price! It's processor is fast enough so that his games run smoothly. Setup was a breeze, and it's very sturdy. This is a great lower price tablet for anyone looking to own a nice tablet for an extremely affordable price. Purchased for 4 yr old granddaughter who primarily uses for Netflix. Works great! Not much to say here. Cheap, fast and very functional. I was able to install google play store and everything works perfectly. Best tablet in its category. If you want something better, you better be ready to pay 3-4 times the price. Great item. My teen lives it. This item offers more than just reading. Tablet was college student. Replace a bulky laptop. Good for taking notes, reading text books and regular books. Loud alarm to wake college student for early classes. All a round got tool for school. its very easy to set up and use. love to take it with me . screen its large enough to read easy on it my 7\" wore out,my 8\" is much better,allthough the covers are expensive and screen protectors are hard to find. the battery life is exceptional !

The screen is awesome and the battery life is great. I love the Fire HD. Went back and bought the Fire 7\" for my wife that afternoon! This was an awesome tablet purchased for my seven year old daughter for Christmas. Initially, I was looking to purchase the iPad mini but unfortunately they were sold out. This was my alternative and I am so glad I did. The price was perfect and the internet and app access have been great! She loves it! The only thing she misses is the FaceTime but it has not been a big deal at all! Gecksqd. Helpful in understanding different things . Upgrade from old Kindle Reader whose charger quit working android system easy to use I really like the value of this Fre. It is thin, light, and has all the features of those higher priced tablets.

The price was affordable compared to other tablets on the market and e 8\" screen is perfect. Another great buy!!! I have an original Kindle Fire and am really enjoying my new updated version. Larger screen and very easy to navigate. I was given a fire when I was recuperating from spine surgery a few years ago. I used it for everything for quite some time. This one has a camera and plays all the latest files. I still have and use the old one as well. An excellent content delivery system. I got it with Best Buy customer appreciation money...what a deal!

The tablet is quick and responsive with plenty of memory to ha for any task. bought this for my elderly mother to play games, get email and pics via Instagram, etc. now she's a geek! easy to use, even for a novice and very reasonably priced.

Love the tablets. Light, Good battery life, and fast performance. It was a fast deliver, the tablets is awsomo and it's a great service My 15 year old is curious about adult material. But with this tablet you can control so much of the content he sees. You can even control how much he learns before watching videos and games.

Bigger screen and great new features. Has Alexis also. Lots of storage as well. I love this tablet. The size fits perfectly in one hand. The display is wonderful and the loaded apps have me reading again. It is the absolute best! Having family members who lose cables all the time, this is a great deal. Reliable cable for the iphone at an affordable price. Plus the various cable colors allow me to assign colors for a person or charging station so we know when someone \"barrows\" a cable. With a little tweaking you can install Playstore without rooting. It's a great tablet, excellent color, fast, and battery lasts a very long time. Bought this table for my 4 and 9 year old for Christmas. They love them! It is a reliable easy to use tablet. Holds charge well and provides for my needs. I bought this for my girlfriend as a Christmas Present. She is a avid reader and has been using our ipad to read online library books. She asked me for a nook reader, but after seeing the fire....it was a no brainer to go in that direction. it is used everyday and she loves it. My grandson love this tablet alot of great games and learning activities. This smokes the Fire 7 which I picked up last year. Powerful and great screen for streaming...cannot go wrong for the price. Bought for my 7 yr old. Quality product at an affordable price. Bought on sale for $69.99. I would recommend this anytime as it's a great product it's For the money the Kindle Fire is the best tablet on the market. I wish I didn't buy my I pad already I would have got one of these for myself. this does everything and more the older, more expensive Kindles. I'm not sure I need my ipad or laptop any more. My son loves it. There are a lot of kid friendly apps available. I left my 7 on airline flight and bought the 8 to replace love love the speed and the video on it. Glad I bought it is worth it!!!! the download speed has improved very much!! I was surprised on how easy it was to use. I bought it for my mother and she totally loves it, and I do too! Oh my, oh my, oh my! Amazon can do no wrong! This device is my precious! Purchased this for my wife during Christmas and got a great deal on it. Compared to the older version that she has this model is faster, brighter, and more convenient with Alexa. I would recommend this product looking for a tablet with lots of features packed in it.

I bought this to replace an older model and am very happy with the product. Mostly used for reading but also for surfing the web, facebook, etc. Love it!! This was a gift for my wife and she loves it!! It is much better than the old one this electronic book reader is great, able to read ebooks, watch movies, play games. or browse the internet. it lets you hookup to any internet connection you want to use as long as its range Last got Fire 7\" for my kids, with an Amazon Freetime subscription. These are very good for the price with two flaws: The screen is good and much better than other Android devices at 7\" but not great, and got the 8 Mb version with I would not recommend in hindsight. Because Android's sub-par management on SD cards, got these this year. It has a much better screen, not only larger but with better resolution, adequate speakers for its price, it's fast enough and overall more enjoyable to use. 16 Gb is the minimum I'd recommend, even with SD cards because some apps just work better with internal storage, and some apps even stored in SD will still use some amount of internal storage.It also has Alexa voice support.The main reason for these tablets in my case is the Freetime subscription that has unlimited access to thousands of age-appropriate books, hundreds (or thousand) of free apps and heavily curved web access per age presets. Amazon Fire OS has a decent support for multi-user and in particular kids accounts. My kids are 7 and 9. They spend a lot of time on games as expected but also read a good amount of books. My wife loves her new Fire 8 tablet. It is easy to use and rubs quickly and smoothly,. Bright screen, lightweight, great price, I love it! It is a very nice tablet, but the 10 inch tablet seems faster and easier to enjoy for the price Really wanted a tablet that was near the nexus 7, but didn't have too much bulk! I looked at the Nvidia Shield as well, and ended up settling on the Fire HD. Tremendous resolution, great battery life, and very easy to use. Highly recommend to anyone that wants a portable tablet for reading, watching videos/movies, and gaming. Works great and has an excellent screen size. You cannot go wrong for the price unless you need to install google apps. Amazon blocks them although I have heard there are work arounds. Great product, good speed, nice resolution for the price. It was easy to set up and use and the screen is big enough to play games on My grandbabie love their kindles this is the 8th Kindle I buy for them I bought this for my son as a first tablet. I am impressed by the built-in parental app. It has a good level of control that I feel comfortable with. My son likes his Kindle. I think he will like it more when he gets used to having to get through the \"educational\" features before he can play. I admittedly need to explore the tablet more myself. That will enable me to customize the settings and the apps for him and myself. First experience with a tablet for my husband who likes it and uses it all the time. We like it. Love the 8 inch HD tablet. Great colors on screen. Not cheaply built like some. This Kindle is the right size for travel, yet large enough to read. Love all the features and price! Kindle Fire HD8 is great! Love the the size and the graphics. Easy to use and navigate. Perfect gift for mom! The battery life is great.Last on a bus trip to kept he quiet. I got this for my wife and she loves it. Great speed and display I got this mainly to watch tv/movies. Battery life is best of all devices I have used to date. Great product for the price! Works great and comes with ample storage. this tablet is excellent i use it on the couch inthe bedroom and in the car too i simplty love it Great resolution, easy to use. Amazon Prime gives you free movies, books, and games! This tablet was a Christmas gift for my dad. It has great resolution and is easy to use. With Amazon prime you get free movies, books, and games. I would highly recommend. We bought this tablet for our 4 year old to play games and watch Netflix. He loves it and at this price point, we're not overly concerned if he damages it. We bought a nice foam case that keeps it well protected. We're highly satisfied. Very good picture and it even takes pictures which is awwsome. You even get a free month of Amazon prime which came in very handy around Christmas Time My daughter loves this tablet! She plays multiple games and has taken video. Easy to use and the color is very vivid! Screen size good for older people. Great resolution and easy to use. Seems to work well. Screen quality is good. Like the size. I had been thinking about getting a reader for a while but did not know which one I wanted. As I looked at and tried several, I thought the Kindal Fire was the one I wanted. After discussing the features of the product with a salesperson, I decided.that it was the reader I wanted. It has turned out to be just what I wanted. I bought this for my son after he broke his iPad, and I am so glad I did!! It has unlimited games and books, which has made such a huge difference in his desire to read!! Love love this tablet!!! Bought this during black friday for $60. while I'm skeptical at first, it turns out to be a solid tablet for everyday use. Not to mentioned the great low price! I love the size of this tablet. I have an Ipad and think I prefer this size. It's easy to carry and a great size for reading. Got it for Christmas and am loving it! I haven't tried to take any pictures yet and I didn't really purchase it for taking photos. I saw the reviews before purchasing and they were not good regarding photo quality. Again, that was not my purpose so am not too concerned at this time. I am thrilled with this purchase! Both affordable and high quality! This tablet works as well or better than my iPad. It is quicker and simpler to use with better speed and reaction. This is almost as good as my iPad mini. i love my apple iPad however this is a great backup. Tablet is great does everythimg as it should. Great entry level tablet This game seems to be another good addition to the Pokemon craze. My son got this for Christmas and has played it often since. He says that it's \"awesome\", which is high praise indeed. So much better than my previous kindle, I've used my new kindle daily and I'm not much of a tech person. It is light weight and easy to navigate. The battery holds a good charge as well I was looking to purchase a tablet for my kids so they could work on homework. This is just what they need in terms of capability and size. It is a great tablet for the price. This tablet is so easy to set up and use. Very intuitive! Love love this device and all of my books can be transferred from my old version! Awesome The reader was easy to setup for a novice reader and email user. 2nd kindle bought as a gift. Easy to operate, can fit in my purse and eliminates having to carry around multiple traditional books. I gave this to my 6-year old for Christmas and it has been the perfect gift. Great price point (compared to an ipad) that can function for exactly what she needs. This is my first Android tablet. I have used numerous Apple iPad's though.The only thing I have been dissatisfied with is that there isn't an Instagram app available but that doesn't have anything to do with Amazon or Kindle. Got one for myself and one for my son. Like the parental settings available. No more inappropriate youtube videos. Fast, great screen and appreciate the blue light setting especially at night. I purchased the HD 8 to use as a viewer for my Pearl RearVision camera, which requires dual band Wi-Fi and Blue tooth. I installed the programs & got everything up and working beautifully. However I was so impressed with its features, performance, and ease of use, that I've added a 128 gb MicroSD card so I can download Amazon videos for my grand kids to watch while we are on the road. The price was terrific as well, but comes with the cost of \"free\" ads when the you turn on the tablet. (FYI the tablet mounts magnetically to the vent holder and is removed when not in use.) My daughter gets great use with this tablet. She loves to read so she gets best of both worlds. She can get her books and surf the web. Fsntastic buy Excellent value for my 3 yr old, everything you need plus HD and the wife can order off amazon prime, so happy wife and kid for the price cant beat it, 2nd one I have owned.... I bought this for my mom. She loves the convince of reading her books on there This product is easy to use and take along with you Great for taking on trips. 16 GB, camera, computer We got this for our 9 yr old daughter and its perfect for her. There hasn't been any issue with the games and educational apps she uses. I was in the middle of moving and didnt want to get a new labtop and found this Amazon Fire for a good price. Ive been very happy with it. If your looking for a cheap easy to use tablet look no further. This is a very good product my kids do homework on it Bought this for our 6 year old daughter and she uses it daily. She enjoys watching movies on it and playing learning games. So far it has been very durable and battery life has been great. Bought this for my husband at Christmas. He is VERY happy with it and It keeps him out of my hair. Bought one for our young son too. Now i can breathe. LOL. We've had no issues with them and has more than met our expectations. Well worth the money & a VERY good deal! My son wanted a tablet just for his books. We looked at e-readers and tablets, this was so much better and the price was perfect. Bought this kindle for my dad for Christmas. He loves it. This tablet is replacing an older model and the updates are wonderful. I can handle most media on this tablet and the resolution is great. I like the change of the camera to the back of the kindle instead of the front screen; now I can see what I'm aiming at! Easy to use and can't beat the price. Love the kindle and the price was excellent. I would recommend it. Bought 2 of these tablets for my kids. They love them and easy to use. Bought this for my son and he absolutely loves it! This is a great tablet for anyone easy to use!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet: With a vivid 8 touch screen and access to Amazon Underground, this tablet makes it easy to watch movies, play games or catch up on your reading with personalized recommendations. Cloud storage offers simple access to your content from anywhere. Great entry level tablet/reader holds a lot and it's expandable of 128 GB Love this tablet daughter uses it mainly and she really likes it good for reading and games as well as web surfing meets all needs ! Our 11 year old daughter received this for Christmas and she seems to love it so fay. Does just enough to keep her entertained and I love the fact that she can easily access her books when she wants. This isn't a high end tablet. Don't buy it if your goal is to play the latest high octane tablet games. But for general use, for most people - web surfing, light games like Angry Birds and those match the fruit games, casting movies to a television - it's an amazing value. The Amazon geared operating system isn't a problem. It took a few minutes to get the Google world onto the tablet. - Google Play, Google Store, Google this and that. The 7\" version is an even better deal, but my mom needed this slightly larger screen. She loves it! Bought this for my father in law who is not tech savvy. The free \"May Day\" feature is the best part- I don't get called for tech support all of the time. bought this for my father, who never did much on computers and was not sure he would actually use this. He unwrapped it, asked for some games to be downloaded and hasn't looked back! He has used the internet as well as the game apps and couldn't be happier. Got this when they were on sale last year and love it!I use it primarily to read and get emails with some surfing. It has worked flawlessly for these applications. Nice tab and worth for its money..got this from best buy during thanks giving and gifted to my friend... Bought for our son so he wouldn't have to carry books back from his deployment I bought this tablet on Black Friday, when it was on special for my little girl. I wasn't expecting much from the tablet... boy was I surprised by its capabilities! Love the tablet! Bought for my 9 years Granddaughter, she loves it. I love my new Kindle. Use it everyday. It is easy to use and understand I chose this a tablet. Very easy to use and navigate. My 6 and 4 year old grandsons can use them with ease. Some apps are limited as you do not have Google Play, but there is plenty of games and learning games available. This was an item I bought for black Friday because the price was really low. I love it. It gets the job done, great travel item. $49.99, is exactly how much it's worth. The sound is low, but again for a good inexpensive, travel tablet, this is a Best Buy:) Long battery life, good screen, reasonably fast.gaming. Got it for my 9 year old son for his Common robot, he loves it, it's very easy to use and for the price well worth it Got this kindle as a Christmas present for my mother and she absolutely loved it. She enjoys reading at night but hates how dim the lights are when she reads a book. This was a perfect compromise! This is a very good tablet for the price, especially for Amazon Prime members. The display is very sharp and so far the battery life is excellent! Great starter tablet without the big cost. Does everything I need. Got this for my wife for Christmas, wasn't sure she would use it. Turned out to be a great gift. Perfect for email, facebook with the Kids, get's her bookclub book delivered instantly from Amazon. And good battery life with a sharp picture. Brought it as a gift for my wife and she loves it! Kindle Fire HD8 is an upgrade for me from Kindle Fire 7. It has many more features and is very easy to navigate. Can't beat the quality and performance of this tablet for $60. I bought it to be my main link with my Amazon Prime. But used it last week instead to download Direct TV app so I could use it to watch the FBS championship game. It worked great but it couldn't help my bama team win. Just what my Niece wanted for Christmas! She is enjoying every minutes use ! Bought for my Grandson for Christmas. He loves it. Glad I went with the 16GB,Thanks to the advice of BEST Buy employee. This is my 4th Kindle - I use it as a tablet when I travel So many apps to look at hard to put down when everythig can be reached at your figertips Great tablet, sturdy, excellent screen quality. Amazon has done a fantastic job of making their tablets user friendly. Excellent for reading books or playing games. Would highly recommend. This is an intermediate size tablet that works very well for its designed purpose. The price was good and it has plenty of acc. Good tablet. A lot of tablet for the money. Great for kids Good price, easy to work and the Grandkids loved . They just keep getting better. This is great for the beginner or pro I only use the kindle fire tablet for entertainment; music, games and eBooks. It's a great basic tablet at a low price. The SD card I added allows me to save lots music and books. The tablet is rather slow in charging but once fully charged it holds up well. Upgraded from 1st generation Fire tablet. Decided to go with 16GB tablet and there were none in store so I had to order for free delivery to store. Arrived on day promised. Was easy to sync new tablet with older tablet. Very nice picture and video. Great value. Wife loves it so makes my life better what else do you need to know past that. The screen size is good and the HD pictures are clear. I also like the camera photos. They are better than my cell phone camera. The size of the pictures are great. I would recommend this Fire HD for the ease of use. I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves this device . The amazon fire hd8 is awesome! Easy to navigate, color is beautiful A great tablet for not a lot of money. Does what the more expensive tablets does for less. Was looking at some more expensive Android tablets to replace a 3-year old device and saw this one on sale. Despite the relatively much lower price, I was originally very worried that the Amazon app ecosystem was going to be sorely lacking compared to the full Google Play catalog. But it turns out that while it is missing some important apps (not just games but productivity apps too), the more than adequate specs (good enough screen, 1.5 GB of RAM, decent processor) are enough for 95% of what I need from a tablet. And if you can get it on sale, you can't go wrong. Lastly, if you're deciding between the 7\" and this 8\" Fire, splurge a little bit and get this one instead. Amazon Fire HD8 is great for browsing and reading. GPS system not that great though. I was not told I had to belong to Amazon. Could not get it to work with my Router. I had been wanting this Tablet for some time and finally decided to purchase it. I am heart sick to have to return it. At one time working with the a general Manager by the name of Brenda on my problems, she was highly disrespectful , embarrassing to me I front of other customers and very rude. Representing Best Buy to the people who actually pay her salary and taking all into account, I would fire her in a heart beat. I understand from other employees she is like this quite often. If you can't fire her maybe taking her off the floor where she has to deal with the public and putting her behind the scenes would benefit Best Buy more than you know. 01-16-2017. Thank you. This is the best thing for reading specially on the go. Now I want one. My older son wants one to. Keep of the good work. It's good budget tablet for someone who wants to use light apps, video streaming, and internet.1.5gb ram is enough for most apps.16g memory and sd card slot gives enough space. Purchased this as a Christmas gift for an adopted family. The teenager absolutely loved it! Awesome tablet! Super quick, great picture, and overall great quality This was bought as a replacement for my wife's previous kindle. She is loving the larger screen and the fact that it has a camera. Nice tablet, gives different choices for readers. Easy to use. Bought the tablet on Black Friday to replace a 4 year old Nexus 7. Liked it so much that I purchased another a week later at full price. Bright clear screen, good battery life, expandable memory, fast and easy to use. No complaints. Bought it for myself. It is everything its advertised to be. Works great; especially if you are a Amazon Prime member. This product met my needs perfectly. It was easy to set up and portable to use anywhere. I bought this tablet during black friday for 60 dollars and it is well worth the price. Definitely an upgrade from the first gen tablet. This watch is not only very useful, it's very cute and comfortable. I love the fitness aspects-it motivates me to be more active. I also enjoy the \"smartwatch\" abilities. I can read my text messages without anyone knowing it! Also, the battery last a few days at the very least. Best Buy has a good price structure for the Kindle Staff members were very helpful Sharp screen that's not too big or small. Takes some getting used to if you normally use an IPhone. Be prepared for ads, which must be the reason they can sell it at such a low price. Slim profile, just heavy enough to feel substantial and high quality. Hard to find cases at physical stores. My friend is enjoying getting acquainted with her first ever electronic device. It is just what she needed to get into the digital age. She is an older woman and is excited about all she can do on her Kindlefire. I was not sure what to expect from this little tablet at such a low price but I am impressed! The 8 inch version is a good size and a lot easier to carry around than my heavier 10 inch tablet. I read negative reviews about the video quality but I have not had any issues and use it to watch Netflix regularly with very clear and uninterrupted quality. The amazon App Store is definitely limited but with an android based system, it is very easy to install the google play store without having to root your device and voiding the warranty. This was a gift for my wife and she has truly enjoyed it. The different lighting for reading so helpful. Very user friendly. For the price best deal out there. Amazon is great tablet and the price is excellent great Have a 7\", wanted a bigger screen. This is perfect and price was great. If you're main purpose is shows, books, light web browsing/social media, and light gaming -- this is the perfect tablet. Very friendly price. Nice construction. Bought as a reading tool for my daughter. She enjoys it and also the fact that she can download apps. Great tool for school and fun Bought for husband to replace his old one.

Perfect for using for my clinicals in nursing school Great tablet for the price, it was a Christmas present and so far so good! Easy to use and the HD is awesome.

Great products as usual and great customer service It helps if your an amazon prime member . You can download a lot more things to do on the tablet A great alternative to the more expensive tablets. Battery lasts for quite a while. Love love love my kindle fire. Had the original and then bought and iPad then bought this kindle and I am wondering why I even bought the iPad. Will not switch again. I will stick with my kindle. ok i did like the product very much thank you for ok I recommend this tablet !!! I like it a lot , perfect size and perfect price Great for reading books. Does everything an iPad or tablet does. Bought for Xmass for my wife. She is not electronic competent, but found is easy to use. This is a excellent tablet for browsing the internet and reading ebooks and for the price you can't beat it.. My ND would way rather have a fire any day than an ipad! Loved the product. First I was disappointed that I could not download Google Store apps but a Quick Google Search fixed that Issue and now I can download any Google Store Apps. The Battery Life is amazing as I was able to Watch around 4 Full Movies on a Single Charge. Performance is great as Games like Marvel Champions Modern Strike Online had no issues. Able to add an SD Card is just perfect as I dont have to worry about Storage for downloading Movies or Apps. Speakers are better then my Samsung Galaxy S7. For the Price point of this Tablet there is not a single thing to Complain. If I have to Brightness of the Screen can be better. Gifted this to my Mom primarily for reading books. Able to check out e-books from our local library. Works great. She also uses this for Skype, e-mails and Facebook. Her grand kids also use it - downloaded few games and play. Bought this during Black Friday sale and was an even better deal. It is a good tablet. My grandson loves it . He was very happy with it . My husband and I have totally enjoyed owning these Amazon Fire tablets. They are so much easier on the eyes than our iphones! Great improvement over the old kindle fire. Better size than the hd7. Not to big and not too small. Fast processing spead. My wife loves it. Great picture quality and easy to use Got this for my 10 year old son. Great for reading books and playing games. Can't beat the price. I have a couple of iPads and decided to get this for general browsing, movie watching etc. Very pleased with the overall package. An added bonus is the very nice Amazon integration. Bought as a gift for my mother. Instead of her feeling locked at the computer she can now access the web from anywhere in the house. This is just the perfect item for what we needed. It is compact and can go anywhere with you. She says this was the best gift she ever received. My kids got this to replace their Ipads and haven't missed a beat. Love the new Fire - great for books, games, and getting online! Easy to use features and perfect size screen to take on the go! Never owned a tablet before, but am loving it so far. great tablet, simple to use, just love it.compatible with other amazon products. I bought this for my Mother because her Nook wasn't working any more. Although it took her a little while to adjust to the new device, she really enjoys it! I wanted a tablet that was a decent screen size, that could play games, that could stream movies (Netflix, Prime), that could check e-mails, that could Skype, etc. all while remaining affordable (under $100). I have yet to see a tablet in this price range that can do all these things effortlessly, while remaining this affordable. This tablet has handled whatever I throw at it, and with no hiccups. I had the cheaper $50 Fire tablet prior to this one, and that thing was slow to process the most basic tasks. If you're looking for an affordable tablet that can do what a more expensive tablet can do, then pick this one up. 4th amazon product I own it is a great budget tablet. Bought this for my wife for Christmas (a perfect gift, if I do say so myself), and seeing the joy that it brings her on a near daily basis makes me want one for myself. Alas, it will be another six years in the sequin mines outside Nashville until I can save enough to get another one. But someday... For the price this tablet is an absolute steal! I've never had an iPad to compare it to but that's only because I've never wanted to spend hundreds of dollars for a tablet. I put a memory card in this and put the Play Store on it (Google it). I use it as a mini office with a Bluetooth keyboard. I love it. This 8\" tablet is much better than the older 7\" tablet. It is faster and have a camera. Great improvement over the older version. This is an awesome tablet, fast, great HD display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment. If you look for a great tablet for entertainment, surfing the net, or reading your e-mail, this is the best you can have. I also purchased a 128 GB SanDisk Ultra Plus memory card. I strongly recommend it, not for work but it’s great for entertainment. Great size. Works with all apps. No issues yet. Would buy more. bought this for my son(12), and he loves it. Constantly on it. Got a great price during the holidays. Completely satisfied. This Amazon Fire is perfect for what I need - nice screen and memory size, really nice apps preinstalled and it's just ready to use! The Black Friday price was beyond wonderful!!!!! Gifts for 4 yr old grandsons very easy for them to maneuver around.. great charge life. We have to force.them to take breaks. I bought this tablet for myself for Christmas! I've enjoyed the ease of use and the price I paid was great. In fact, I purchased another for my son for Christmas. This is the perfect tablet for basic use or if upgrading from the kids edition of the Amazon Fire. Much less expensive than an iPad and more durable if you have a tween who isn't always careful with their tech. Had to chose between Fire 10 and Fire 8. For the money, you can't go wrong with the Fire 8. Screen is good for \" older eyes\". This is perfect for kids. The parental controls make me feel secure in letting my child use the tablet safely. I would recommend this to other grandparents for their grandkids this works great if you use amazon a lot and watch movies from amazon Great product for surfing the internet or reading books! Bought this as a gift for my aunt and she loves it. Easy to get connected and set up. She is totally non-techny and was able to do it herself. Great buy!

Would buy again. Bought it on sale for Christmas gift and we'll worth the money. Does everything needed with good functionality. Easy to use for those not too tech savvy. Bought this as a gift - they seemed to like it. The price was nice and so was the size of it.

Purchase this tablet during the Christmas holidays on sale. Got as a gift for my job's Christmas gift party. The person who got it was very happy with it. I am familiar with the tablet because I bought one for my wife when they first came out for her to use to read her books. Good tablet for book reading and audio books, many good apps to chose from. Very good for picking up e-mail when traveling. I'm still finding more ways to use it. Only had it about a month. This is a great little tablet especially for the price. The new tablet is great ！ nice upgrades！Love how easy it is to use. Easy to get apps, shop and browse the web. I bought the Kindle Fire HD as a Christmas gift for my mom.

I bought this as a light-weight alternative to an iPad for collecting and enjoying Kindle and Amazon Video products. When combined with the dedicated Fire cover, it's low price along with a very readable screen and the option for a Micro SD card make it an excellent choice for travel and time spent in waiting-rooms, etc., allowing lots of memory space for ones library as well as flexibility regarding how it is held or positioned. My grandson broke his Amazon fire table one day after warranty expired. He was disappointed. So I bought him an 8 version . He had a big smile. This serves every function I need in a tablet. Price is right. It's a handy little tool to have for reading e-Books. Easy to use, fast, sleek and battery holds good charge , happy with it Very easy to use and navigate. Perfect size to carry in my purse and still a good sized screen to watch movies. This product is very user friendly and it is very lightweight This was bought primarily for photos. I added the 128 card. Putting in the 128 card might have been a little tricky but the sales rep did it for me. My wildlife photos look brilliant on the tablet. I'd recommend making a Geek Squad appt for about an hour after you plan to buy the tablet. That way you learn how to use it before leaving the store. Also I got one that had been returned but all the parts still had the plastic wrap on them. That made it $100 less and hence the \"great deal\" in the title. It may pay to ask about a return. I plan to take some of the free classes offered. It was well worth the Black Friday price! The screen is so clear, it is easy to handle especially for people with not so big hands, easy and fast when navigating. This is an awesome tablet. it is fast with great pictures! Price was right, great tablet for playing games and reading I got this tablet for Black Friday at a decent price. It's 8 inches, you can add more space with a micro sd and very easy to use.

It was to replace her iPad mini 1 that they have basically designed to become in operable within 2 years. She can add storage to the Kindle, the picture is fire, and she can read a plethora of books that suit her fancy. It's nice size and responsive. Perfect for face timing with family. Perfect for travel. Convenient and way to use. First tablet for me. Very happy. I love this! I use it daily! And I love the fact that I can add a ad card for more memory! Love it and would recommend it for the young as the old Kids got the kindle fire for Christmas, pretty happy with it. Nice size screen. Very fast easy to use nice size nice screen I love my old kindle, but after a few years and drops the power button doesn't like to work a lot of the time. So took advantage Black Friday deal to replace the one that is going out. Basically, the tab's features are good. There are huge Amazon collections. Kids can be allowed to use it without parents monitoring as parents control feature is good. Several useful Amazon products are offered free of charge. I hope that It is worth for the money value. nice tabket for the money with many nice features and durable I love the kindal because i am a reader. i able to check out books from library through overdrive but if i get an alert about world event i simply go to ond of the news app's and get the latest headline.

My son enjoys it no complaints works great long battery life holds a charge better than any tablet i have ever had love it, can do alot of stuff on it, would recommend fire hd8 to everyone This is the 3rd Kindle Fire that I have purchased. This one is much faster and more user friendly. We just bought our 2 grand daughters and 2 grandsons a Kindle Fire with the youngest 8 yrs old. He has it mastered already. Great tablet for a good price. This is an awesome product love the flexibility it has with not only book reading but other apps as well. This is my second kindle. Love size of screen and it is super light. Great camera. We originally owned an original kindle but it was slow app store was not the best and overall interface was to be desired. In fact eventually the device crashed and couldn't be recovered with limited use. Deeply debated about getting another and actually bought a Samsung tablet, but it was too small. This was such a good deal it was hard to ignore and have been very happy to give another try. This device is a great size and much better interface. Would buy again and will consider in the future for the kids. My daughter loved it nd I love that she leaves my phone alone now. We ordered one for each of our 2 boys (ages 7 and 5) as Christmas gifts. They love them. Setup took a bit of time to get the Amazon store and parental controls, but well worth the time once its was all set up. We set it all up before wrapping them so the kids could enjoy them right away. It's their favorite gift this year. Easy to use and great quality. All 3 of my kids have a Kindle Fire I bought this e reader for myself and I love it. The price was great and the product is nice. I got this for myself on black Friday. I have had 2 Kindles before but never the Fire. Love it! I love the fact that is very practical and I didn't have to spend a lot of money. Well my kids love them. So that's great for me. The only bad thing I can say is i can't figure out how to make it so they can download free games and not ones that cost money. Got this kindle on black Friday for a great price. It is a good performer at a great price. I use it as a nice versatile tablet, not just for kindle bok reading. Wow this tablet for the price of 40$ at the time what a value. Works very well, easy to use, great for beginners. This imy 3rd kindle device.I chose it becazuse it haf more memory/stoeage This is a great tablet plus you can't beat this price. I got this tablet on Black Friday. It was a great price, and being a Prime member, it has become my favorite entertainment venue on the go. The screen's not as sharp as an iPad or Samsung tablet, but for the price I got it for and its entertainment value, it can't be beat. I bought my fire tablet during the Christmas sale season for a great price to replace my aging iPad. I am really impressed with the speed of downloads and the quality of the video. I added an inexpensive SD card to download videos and shows. It is great for travel. I bought the Amazon Fire HD 8 for my husband for Christmas. He's never too excited about gifts but he is using this tablet every day and even though he won't admit it, he absolutely loves it. Would definitely buy again, especially during Black Friday specials. This tablet was a gift to my daughter because she's an avid reader and anime watcher.

Easy for her to learn how to operate. First of all, this is not an iPad or a more expensive android tablet, but it's a very good tablet for the money.

No need to purchase an overpriced tablet for children I haven't had my Fire long enough to have explored all it has to offer. I've downloaded a couple of audio books that sound great and are easy to install and play. Not my way to watch movies or TV but the screen is nice. Very clear and sharp. Audio is just OK from the speakers, you'll want some nice head phones or buds for music or movies. I really like the Fire 8, it seems like a lot of gadget for the money. I use this tablet often. It is the perfect size. The battery last a long time. The quality is great for the price Love my purchase of my Amazon fire Hd 8. It was a very good experience Love it, vivid HD color, it replaces other devices I have. Watch movies, play games, read e books. the salesgirl was very knowledgeable and helped me pick out the right tablet for my needs. It works well as promised. It was great and great for the kids and adults thanks my 9 yr old loves her new tablet . she had a nabi and likes this better Love the Tablet. Wonderful battery life. Great for Movies. This is a good tablet for the price. I dont have a lot of apps. I use more for reading and watch videos. I think is a good deal.

I love this kindle works great for me I will be ordering another one today for my wife.  I needed a tablet to keep at the hospital during overnight stays so I decided based on price to get the kindle 8 and I am pleased I did! For only $89 the bright picture, sound, storage, and ease of use is well worth it. Very Nice upgrade! Love the speed to watch movies and to play games! I broke my Fire 7 and decided to move up to the 8 and could not be more happy. I bought this for reading but love the extras. Works great! Great reading options. Absolutely love my kindle. There was a glare on the screen when I was out in the sun, but once my eyes got adjusted it was just fine! I was looking for a tablet within a reasonable price range, after doing a little research I decided to give the kindle a try and it was a GREAT decision! It has so many uses and makes it so much easier to get things done than using my phone. I would recommend for any age. I love my new kindle. It was a birthday gift to myself. Best decision I could have made. A lot of bells and whistle. I love it because it was to navigate. Heck, I am doing this review on my kindle. Best Fire tablet at a reasonable price. Much faster than the 7 inch. I like the size of the device as well as the expandable storage Bought this for my wife to replace her old one and she loved it wonderful, I have 3 more at home, worth the money. I am impressed with the quality and speed of this tablet. I was a little worried about not having access to the Google Play store, but this has not been a big issue so far. The speed, functionality, and battery life have exceeded my expectations. It's a nice updated tablet. No problems yet. Decent price for what you get Replacement tablet for my wife - no complaints! She watches Netflix on it a lot. This tablet was inexpensive, very lightweight, and performs just as good as the more expensive ones. Great product... easy to use!

It's a very nice tablet and very economic tool, my kids enjoy it and I love the parental controls too It's definitely a must have. I like to read books also browse social media and the web. Must have Our daughter loves her new tablet. It has a bigger screen more features and she just enjoys being on it. The kindle is priced right and is easy to use. She was able to get her apps transferred to her new tablet in no time. Great investment. Best tablet for the money and then some, loads fast, good quality graphics too. I needed to upgrade my electronics since I haven't bought a tablet in a couple of years. What I had at home wouldn't stream what I wanted to see. I went in looking for a 10in and came out with this 8in after the sales assoc. showed me its features & answered my questions. Much more portable than a 10in would have been too. If you are looking for a tablet to read books, play games, watch netflix or amazon, and to travel with, look no further. This tablet has everything you need. it does not have the greatest camera, but you have a phone for that. No reason to spend more money on anything else.

Great reader and tablet enjoy the video graphics nice unit. Really love my Fire HD. Very easy to browse the internet. Is an excellent EBook Reader. Amazon apps are great! The screen is big and the Kindle is easy to navigate. Having Amazon prime definitely makes it worth the investment Bought this for my elderly non-tech friendly mom.

Mainly used for reading kindle books, but tablet does many other things! Goes with me everywhere I go! When I decided on this I was shopping for something but didn't know what. After using I have decided this is it. Does all I need. This screen on the hd8 is a huge improvement over the past kindle or fire devices. The operating system is sometimes glitchy, but overall a nice system for the money. Be sure to join Amazon Prime and have access to lots of free reading downloads Affordable and kid friendly. My kids watch videos and play games on these a lot. Lots of apps, games and books to choose from! I bought this tablet to replace my old kindle fire. So far, it has exceeded my expectations.

Glad I upgraded to the Fire Kindle as it is much easy to read on than the black and white Kindle I had previously. The color and graphics are very clear. It is easy to work on for many tasks, and the search mode is great. This is our first tablet, we were looking for a tablet to get us started and this is nice and inexpensive way to get started. We will use this for a while to get used to the whole app thing. I purchased the Kindle fire to replace my iPad that stopped working. It is so much easier to use and lighter than an iPad. I wish I had purchased one years ago. Kindles are easy to carry when traveling on long flights. Can't believe I waited so long to get a real e-reader. So easy to read from.

I use it to read emails and watch Netflix Goo graphics and easy to use. Does much more than you think. A perfect gift. Great Fire tablet! Speedy service and experience! Bravo! This is a cheap tablet but really worth for the price. I bought this when it is on sale for $69 + $40 for 128 GB SD card, you have a great tablet when plenty of space. I used ipad for a while but i think it is so overpriced . This tablet is a deal !!! Excellent replacemwnt for an older model of rhe kindle. This is our 2nd one, my wife was using my most of the time, so I got her one. It reads my textbooks to me while I play card games. Why did I wait so long to buy this thing? I should add that I am an Amazon Prime member so that might be needed to take full advantage of this feature. Cortonna will read all of my books to me. I didn't have to upgrade my books or pay extra per book. Enjoy having a device that I did not have to pay for through the nose. Enjoy having a device that makes it easier to read on the go. Great light weight tablet that uploads quickly. Would recommend. This is a very responsive device for the amount paid Amazon - Fire HD8 - 8 - Tablet - 16GB - Wi-Fi - Black I purchased this for my sister. I really appreciate the Geek Squad for setting this product up for her and for teaching me how to use it. Now I can pass that I learned onto my sister. 8 years old daughter is happy with this tables,work very well with wifi and is easy to download app. Perfect for basic stuff, games and media. Reading, too. Purchased for book reading but works well as a tablet. Wasn't thinking that it would be a full replacement for my old IPad but working well as one. whats to say.................................................it's Kindlelishous!!!!!!!!!!!!! I purchased this as a Mother's Day gift for my Mom in Florida. I don't have first hand experience with it but the price point is great and the other reviews seem solid. I did watch a few unboxing videos on youtube and it seems to be a great deal. Some people seem to have issues with the screen being too glossy but other than that I don't see a ton of other problems. This tablet has beautiful color graphics and is super thin. Easy to carry with you. My son loves his new tablet. He goes on it as soon as he gets home from school. and it holds a LOT of data plus you can add more storage... been using it a lot. I was looking for a kids tablet for my grandson but this one is so much better because it can grow with him and it has a kids mode on it which is really nice so he can't order or go online without permission. He loves this tablet and it's very well build . We bought the Fire as an easy way for our 97 year old mother to see pictures of the family from all over the country. It was very simple to set up and learn to use. She plays games on it, as well...... My 8 year old niece cracked her screen on her former tablet, I needed to get her a replacement. This tablet fit the bill exactly, a great screen, relatively fast CPU, and best of all, it's cheap!I was able to find instructions online for installing Google PlayStore, in which I then gave her the tablet. She loves it! I love the Amazon HD8! It is a great tablet for reading and surfing the web! It has a fast processor and amazing resolution. I would definitely purchase this product again. Great product for my 8 year & affordable.. had 2 months & no problems Great but I wouldn't use it for a sole purpose as being my primary tablet A perfect tablet at a reasonable cost. Why pay higher prices for bells and whistles you don't use. The back lit feature is great for reading in low light conditions. I got a kindle fire when they first came out. Time to update and great choice, good graphic, great for catching up on your favorites show better than watching on a phone!! Bought this for my daughter. She loves it. Wifi connection is great. She mostly uses YouTube and google. Love the easy way to control parental accounts from my account. Very useful. I did buy a cover to put on it, because it's so thin, I was afraid it would break. I bought this tab for my daughter's birthday.its got a good screen and sound for the price. I also play for the children's app freetime which is perfect for her. I needed a kindle for my schooling so I decided to look into this and read some reviews. After reading the reviews I decided on this kindle and it is perfect compared to my other tablet. Like the ability to play a game or 2 when I take a break from reading... Easy to use, light weight, fits in a small purse or bag. still learning new things about my tablet. very easy to use.. perfect size. We have been using our Kindle Fire 7 for years and it wore out. We looked at replacing it with another Fire 7 until I saw the Fire 8. The display is great and the weight is not that big of a difference. Enjoy the multifaceted opportunities that are available with the Kindle This tablet is very easy to set up and use- it's just as advertised. I had the original Kindle and just decided to upgrade. It ​is a very functional and easy to use. My 10 year old daughter loves it. Battery great to Several friends suggested I buy the Kindle Fire. I love it!! Great for traveling! I can check my email, update my Facebook status and read all from one device. I had a new one but it stopped working....So I just went and bought a new one. Works great!!\n"

            "This product so far has not disappointed. children love to use it and like the ability to monitor control what content they see with ease. great for beginner or experienced person. Bought as a gift and she loves it Inexpensive tablet for him to use and learn on, step up from the NABI. He was thrilled with it, learn how to Skype on it already... bought this for grand daughter when she comes over to visit. set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price think this tablet is best one out there. You can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost. This fire 8 inch tablet is the perfect size. purchased it for husband so that he has a bigger screen than just his phone. He had gotten one a few years ago so knew it would be a good purchase. gave this as a Christmas gift to inlaws, husband and uncle. They loved it and how easy they are to use with fantastic features! Great as a device to read books. like that it links with borrowed library ebooks. Switched from another popular tablet brand and am happy with the choice made. It took some time to get books from previous nonKindle reader, but finally figured out a way! Excellent product. Easy to use, large screen makes watching movies and reading easier. Got it as a present and love the size of the screen The kindle is easiest to use, graphics and screen crisp, clear, brilliant colors. Great video quality lots of fun apps fun for the whole family Love love love kindle fire 8.....this is what 9 yr old granddaughter said when bought this for her at Christmas.. have purchased kindled in the past but this one has been the best....love the fact that you can now use a memory card in it...that helps so much when you use it for books...games...music and viedos...thanks Excellent tablet with nice screen. wish would pre install the play store, this would have been perfect. Preloaded with the reading app from Kindle but expandable with other apps. Perfect for travel. Carry your library, games and productivity apps in a small footprint. Very happy with this product and easy to use..picture is clear, takes great pictures.. grandchildren are home schooled and utilize the tables for many learning apps! They LOVE using them as it makes them feel \"so grown up\"! The tablets are a great leaning tool and they are receiving many benefits from them! Great size, easy to carry for traveling. Need to spend more time Looking into apps for contact manegement, interactive calenders and most important, music storage and use. was surprised when learned of the capabilities of this device. Now husband has more access to his desktop and am doing things which couldn't on his device. The visual quality on the Fire 8 HD is amazing. It runs very fast and is easy to use, very durable. This is a great tablet for the price, would recommend it to anyone looking for a basic tablet. am still learning all the things can do with new Kindle Fire. It is so much better (lighter in weight and easier to use) than old tablet. Just the right size for reading books and playing some games. love everything about this tablet! The imaging is sharp and clear. It's fast and light weight. Love it! This is exactly what the person wanted as a gift and she enjoys using it. It's fast and easy to use. This is second kindle fire . For the money you cannot beat this tablet. Full of features, picture quality is great, and very fast speed while using the internet. Easy to use, solid build, sharp HP screen for movies. Who needs more? this is first tablet .. love it .. actually read first ebook on it .. large screen, easy to read  play games .. fits nicely in purse Sleek packaging easy set up and great for anyone who wants a e reader with more to offer. Best and most affordable option of all the Kindle devices available. did not want to get a new kindle but old one would not charge or show a charge anymore. could not depend on it for any length of time so finally broke down and bought a new one. am very happy with this one. was afraid would lose music and photos since not all came from the store. However, everything had on the old kindle transferred to the new one. am still learning all about it but so far so good. Excellent tablet to leave at easel and display reference photos. It's light enough to velcro to a articulating stand (so can position the tablet right next to canvas). It's cheap enough to not worry about. love it, for the price. bought this wanting for books comics and movies and it has not disappoint ever since 4 year old Grandson loves his Kindle. He had to have one after his sister got one. Easy to use. As a beginner found this pad very good. Enjoy the kindle app. Purchased this for daughter to do more reading. It has so much more options for her if she wants. this is a great tablet for the price. kid loves it ,does alot reading on it. believe that this will be very useful during husbands recovery from foot surgery. This is a wonderful device. love the extra capabilities and apps. am very happy with this tablet. The worst thing is that steals it all the time. Lol A family member has vision problems. They had seenused the Kindle of another family member  especially the ability to scale text. This device will make it possible to read, which she has had extreme difficulty doing. Easy setup and connect to WIFI. Great viewing area. Easy to read in bright places. got this fire for friend who wants to buy kindle..this serves both Kindle and Tab... very nice and very cheap..worth for what paid.. highly recommend this for beginners Amazing tablet with fast processor. It looks great... got good deal got this for 5 year old and this is really great for the price. Works like a charm!! find it easy to use, but the kindle does not come with instructions, so you have to find your way around. love this tablet. The battery life last a long time. use Kindle Fire predominately for watching movies on Prime, Netflix's, and checking emails. also carry it to appointments and meetings. It is a compact tablet, and not big and bulky. The playback of the movies are great, and the movies are HD. Great little tablet if you are looking for something to watch movies and checking emails. would definitely recommend this tablet to friends and family members. daughter loves this kindle, she does so much with it,well worth the money. Was looking for a tablet that was highly portable  could run DIRECTTV app  stream videos. (Other electronics have are much older versions). sman recommended this model to based on personal experience. am still learning all its functions but so far it seems easy to use  is doing what it promised to do. This is second Fire, the other one is now retired. like having HD. Works just fine. wife bought this for for birthday. enjoy reading biographys which usually have color photos. The regular Kindle make the pics black and white or they're aren't any. This allows to see the color photos. also love the night feature when 'm in bed reading. no longer need a light on to read or need to hold a large book. Thanks to a knowledgeable, lowpressure sperson, was ready to buy first tablet. This one was the right price (on ) and have not been disappointed. Every few days learn more ways to use it besides checking emails  checking out library books  audio books. It stays charged for days, even with regular use. recommend it as an inexpensive and very satisfactory alternative to more expensive tablets. It's a great tablet for the price. Don't expect it to be as fast more expensive ones. It's meant for casual use and it does a great job at that. For the price, you can't beat it. Get a nice large microsd card and you don't have to worry about space. It runs a little slow on certain things if you are multitasking but it's a simple tablet. 've run plenty of 720p videos without fail. It's great for ebooks or other files. Some more elaborate pdfs take a while to load if they have a lol of graphics. Battery life seems good for a small table too.The only real Issue have is the App store being limited. It is an offshoot of Android but not all the same apps are available. There is a way around it but wish they would just allow it access to Google Play or at least offer the same apps.So, it's a nice inexpensive table that works great. For the money, you will love it but don't get upset that is doesn't run as fast as a 500 tablet. That's not its job. Very easy to use tablet. Lots of apps and game available. love the FreeTime settings for kids on the newer Kindle Fires. was able to create a login for each of kids as well as myself and set limits to the amount of device time they are allowed daily (can set to more for weekends if desired). You can set the age restrictions for content also, to avoid inappropriate ads, etc. Once you've downloaded apps, you can choose which ones you want each child to have access to in their profile settings, so if one child is older you can allow them access to something their younger siblings shouldn't have. Basically, like that can set their access rights and know they're safe so don't have to continually monitor every moment. By the way, FreeTime kids settings are available without having to subscribe to their FreeTime app access plan. :) Purchased as a door prize gift given with a one year membership. The recipient loves it and says it performs very well. (As a past Fire user, now Pad graduate, loved Fire for more than 4 years without any problems. In fact, just recycled it on to son and it runs like a champ). have 4 other kinds of tables. This the best have had. can listen to music, read a book, listen to a book, or watch moviestv shows. Great product for the kids gaming apps parental controls to make sure you can monitor kids and prevent unwanted app purchases purchased 2 of these tablets for 6 and 8 year old. They were a special for 59. They are perfect for the apps and games they wanted. Great product. Love the ecosystem. The Freetime subscription is a must Needed something a bit larger than the 6 to stream Netflix, this was perfect! husband bought this for as a Christmas present. couldn't understand why he bought it because already have a Kindle Fire.Once opened it and got it going, loved all it could do plus the graphic is so much colorful than older Kindle. am a prime member  love this tablet. Very user friendly especially if you are a prime member with . Not real tech savvy so need all the help can get to keep things simple  automatic. Great clarity of picturedata. Have a 10\" tablet and wasn't sure about downgrading size (old eyes) but was delighted to see it works fine at 8\" instead of 10\". Also, easier to take around in the smaller size. Highly recommend especially if you subscribe to and are a prime member. Great benefits!! Got this for wife.

Has many educational apps would definitely go into the settings if you're a mother like who Is a very strict of what your children watch on TV or what games and apps they download would definitely recommend setting the parental controls before giving it to them. In personal opinion as a mother feel it helps by setting the restrictionscontent on It helps keep their mind away from the gutter Bcuz most apps and Internet websites have inappropriate sites children should not be watching. can't control what they put on the Internet but can control what children watch and download they stay very occupied on educational apps ,read books most of these apps are free to also recommend NOT putting a payment method option other than that kids loved it Very nice for light internet browsing, keeping on top of email, viewing videos, and reading e books, which like to get free from the library.

THE PRICE OF THIS TABLET IS MIND BOGGLING!! This tablet has everything you would expect and want in a tablet and more. It has Store and Prime preloaded. It's so much fun and so easy to use. THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS TABLET IS UNBELIEVABLE. You never stop thinking about the modest price you paid for such a fantastic tablet. It feels comfortable in your hands. The design is nice. The size is adequate for all tablet use. You can expand the memory storage of this device an additional 240GB. Can you believe it? Outstanding!! Bought as a Christmas present. Son uses it to watch youtube and Netflick. Works great. Got this Fire tablet for youngest daughter for Christmas and she loves it. also love the option to restrict apps and content for her age! bought two of these Fire HD tablets in December as Christmas gifts. Both recipients are happy with these as gifts. plan to purchase one in the near future for myself. Biting as a gift, only concern was the size and the interface. It was easy enough to download the Google play store, so it was familiar to the user. Size was an initial concern, but it was just right to watch movies without being so cumbersome. Very easy to use and has so much to offer for the low price. great product, easy to use, love the lighted pad, ease of down loading books, They were using them on Christmas morning!! It didn't take them long too be getting the best from those tablets love it is nice read book on it play games on it bought this Kindle as a gift for mother so she could access her Facebook account easily. She loves the ease of using it. have 3 kindle tablets in home and they are used daily. mother uses hers for email and some light gaming and for watching Netflix as well. Very satisfied. wanted a low cost internet device to feed internet radio choices into stereo. This fit the bill well. use the headphone jack to connect with stereo and get great sound. don't use most of the other apps that come on the device. The Kindle Fire is a wonderful, small device to use for a multitude of tasks. use it mostly as an ereader and has been so simple to use. So happy chose this one. It is lightweight and convenient to take with you. bought this as a temporary replacement for wife's 11\" Kindle Fire HD that was out for service. She liked this 8\" model so much that she continued using it after the 11\" one returned. So easy to download and then read. Enjoy reading that can take anywhere without the heaviness of a book bought this after subscribing to an Prime membership. This is a great little tablet at such a low price.. too good of a deal to pass up when it was on . It has the ability to talk to Alexa, surf the web, listen to music and read booksmagazines (lots of free music and books for Prime members). This is second Fire, 'm upgrading from the 2nd generation 7\" model. Love the screen resolution. Movies and videos are sharp and no pixelating. The camera is a bonus first version did not have. All together this was a great buy for under 100 on . Thank you . This tablet has it all. offers tons of free apps, hundreds of thousands of free ebooks and tons of free games. The tablet is intuitive and intelligent. seamlessly enjoy streaming favorite shows and reading articles, books and periodicals. What love most is that the tablet doesn't place all apps on the device, but uses the users miro SD card instead for up to 200GB of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games, apps, books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. It also allows the owner to share the device with family members, delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. There is even an option to create children's accountsextra bonus. am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto Samsung Smart television. will definitely consider first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. It maintains a charge for a good deal of time, alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day, sometimes two days. No one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the ownerenduser. love to read and this tablet makes it so easy to carry an entire library with everywhere. have also become addicted to the free underground games. Bought this 8\" model to use in addition to current 3 year old Kindle Fire HD (7 inch model). So far am very pleased with the quality of this unit. The slightly larger screen makes watching movies much better. didn't want the larger 10\" screen (yet). purchased this on because could pass on the price. The tablet works great for basic internet needs and great for shopping on . If were to purchase another Android Tablet, will look for something with a little more power since this tablet slows when multitasking. bought this for son (he's 1.5 years old) so he could play basic toddler games, but found the tablet to be extremely useful for school with it's large screen and super long battery life. 'm waiting for the Surface Pro 5 but this tablet that got for so cheap is making second guess paying so much! For basic lecture taking notes and watching Netflix or Hulu and kid games, this can't be beat. The best tablet for the price use it everyday to watch youtube videos This tablet is perfect for just about anything you could want to do on a tablet. Great item at great price, WIFE LOVES IT AND WONT PUT IT DOWN! Wanted a tablet at a cheap price and this item fit the bill. Bought on which made the price even better. The screen looks good and the performance for the apps have used so far have met expectations. mainly used for surfing the web, youtube, and netflix. This device handles each with ease. Overall, am satisfied with this device. Works well; no issues with reboots or system hangs.. Good size  not too big and not too small. Screen is good for reading. Battery life is good, 've bought a few books from but mostly sideloaded books from the library onto a 32 GB micro sd card. got this for son and he loves it! He can play games, watch movies, you tube videos, and use the internet for help with homework. He also loves all the books, and aps. Was a great deal should have gotten one for myself. purchased this product for youngest son! He loved the color and the size. The storage is great for the number of activities that he has downloaded! Was looking for a tablet to run remote music server with from easy chair. first tablet bought at about the same price ran through the battery in an hour. product is much better for battery life and image quality is very nice. This product is easy to use. Screen size is great. Would recommend to anyone. got it for kid and she loves it. The free time and prime well worth the money Best tablet around, cheaper than most and does just as much as other tablets. Great buy, it works perfect! Battery lasts a few days too. She likes to read books and this is a fast and cheap way for her to do so It's a great buy. Just to read emails and go on the web Great Christmas gifts for the kids. Hours of fun and games. purchased this tablet mostly for entertainment. enjoy playing games and this tablet is great for that purpose. Also plan on using it for reading electronic books. So much more screen size than previously kindles. Fast charging. Longer battery life. Purchased for mom to read ebooks, great performance, screen looks good, easy to use. Very happy with this purchase. less expensive than last year with so many more features and bigger screen! Bought for wife for Xmas and she loves it. Hasn't put it down Better and faster than Kindle 7\". Great performance for the price. You can do some many things and the best part apps for free on underground! Works great for 6 year old. Wanted an inexpensive tablet for himsince he can be pretty rough with things. So far so good, and love the FreeTime app. Bought 2 for each of teenagers and they just love it... Very cool reading features and zero buffering while watching Netflix. mother, husband, and daughter all enjoy using Fire. It's a great way to stay preoccupied. Out of all the tablet choices out there buy these for children over any other. You can't beat the price and durability. very good product and right on the cost! Great gift for the holidays. Great for reading, game playing, searching the web and social media. really like the Fire IS 8 16gb, it is fast and smooth. This is so easy to use and does exactly what hoped. Great tablet for streaming ! good internet connection along with a nice display Bought it as an ereader. Convenient and easy to use. Text is very readable. am pleased. So cool after playing with this for a while now would never spend the money on an apple for what am doing with it. Love the new fire hd 8. Price is amazing and if you are an prime mbr its even better! Great for the kids as you can lock their profiles to a kids mode and they can't buy anything. If had one downfall its the smaller amount of apps available than apple or google play. Had the Fire HD 7\" before and just wanted to upgrade. Loving it so far and really enjoying the bigger screen! The tablet is not for it is for a Christmas gift This was a great buy for son. He needed something that he could easily transport and that woudl allow him to access the internet and various forms of media. This was a perfect choice since he also has a Prime account. This was replacement for wife's original iPad and broken Kindle Paperwhite. She loves it, as it does basically everything both of the previous devices did in one unit that is easy to use, has good battery life, very nice screen resolution and good size for her. Great value, especially compared to an iPad. for the price this is a great works well the for the price display is hd love it for the money, you will be well pleased, think it is a big bargain ! purchased this tablet for mother, but set it up and tested it out. It is super fast! have the original Kindle Fire and all can say is has come a long way! The new Fire HD8 is so much better than the original! like it so much that am thinking of purchasing one for myself! would highly recommend this tablet to anyone! Very happy with this purchase, it was exactly what was looking for original Kindle Fire no longer accepted a charge. wasn't going to replace it, because bought an iPad. When saw the HD8 in a kiosk in a BB store, realized how much better liked the size and feel of it for reading books (the iPad is preferred for other things). This Fire's clarity is much improved over old one, plus it responds better. don't like that can't choose a photo for the locked screen  that it HAS to be an advertisement. also don't like that it usually takes a few trys to unlock. Menial issues from perspective. This is third Kindle, still have the other two; however, this has a camera and much larger screen. would take this product any day over a tablet. wife and kids love easy to use and the size is perfect Great tablet for beginners! Very light and screen is wide. Enjoy using for travels. This is just the right size and can put games on it just like an iPad. The Kindle is a great way to read and watch videos with ease! 've had other Kindle Fire for 56 years. It's still working but slowing down. bought the updated version while it was on . love it! play games on it, download books, check email and facebook. It's like a portable mini computer and wouldn't be without it. like it better than other people's tablets and you can't beat the price. bought some for gifts and everybody loves it! 'd recommend it to people of all ages. Bought a Fire HD 8 tablet for wife. She doesn't like using computers and avoids smartphones, but her new tablet is a big hit. She uses it to play games and to stream movies and radio programs. use it for everything else  reading news, checking email, online shopping, etc. It was very easy to set up and even easier to use. Plenty of speed and capacity to do everything want. already own kindles so know they are great ! son is going to live this! purchased 2 of these FIre HD tablets as gifts. They pack a lot of punch for the price. helped set them up so was able to get an idea of how they are going to work. The screen was very nice and clear. Speed of tablet was good. It is easy to use.

With a 20 off deal last blackfriday, who will not get it. Much clearer and faster than the other fire HD. Light weight too This is 2nd Fire tablet. will alwyas need one. Just wish they lasted longer than 4 years. While there are some apps that are missing due to not using the Google Play Store the list is minimal. The tablet itself is quick, responsive, and noticeable nicer than the 7\" fire. Picked this up when it was on for s. It's great for in front of the TV and catching up on email and light web browsing. Was impressed how quick and responsive touch and overall speed.Including Alex app.fit in top coat pocket have been buying Kindles since they first came out. When ever want to upgrade Kindle is chosen brand. am not very tech savvy and enjoy watching movies, listening to music and primarily reading. like the ability to purchase narration for favorite titles and using texttospeech for the rest.

It has helped him improve in his reading skills. are glad bought it. Thank you. This was one of the best birthday presents, ever purchased for husband. He said he doesn't use the computer, but he was on smartphone daily viewing FB. got him a drone for Christmas and he needed something to view, while it is flying. researched the Kindle Fire and thought he could practice with it until spring. He farms, so isn't busy in the winter. Thank goodness, because he is busy with his Kindle for hours every day. He thinks it is great and do too, because now have phone back. really enjoy reading. So much so was running out of shelf space. have read a few books with pad mini but it really didn't do the trick. No so with new Fire Hd8. Handy sized, not the least bit heavy and super bright. Add in the face that digital material from magazines to novels are often as not far cheaper that \"hard copies\". Amazing video quality easy to maneuver wonderful screen size easy set up The Fire HD8 strikes an excellent balance between performance and price. It has many of the features you'd want in a tablet for a fraction of the cost. Works flawlessly for reading and video streaming. This is second Kindle and love it. It's lightweight, simple, and fast. It's convenient for trips and fits in bag without weighing it down. Bought this as a gift. mother likes it. It's easy and simple to use. am loving fire tablet and am using it everyday at home and at work on break Very little set up, helpful in setting up the functions. Clear pictures and easy to use. Take pictures both ways Bought this for mom and it was just what she needed and at a great price. Been wanting to get an Ipad for myself, but think this might be a great less expensive option for as well. 'm loving the tablet so far. really like the underground, and the Fire OS just updated, so it has Alexa on it now. :) this tablet is perfect for surfing the internet and following social media For its price. Amongst the others felt this was a deal Smartphone works on the job for , but with the Fire can read instructions and worksheets. It is a useful tool for connecting with both friends and colleagues. 8inches is the right size for holding in hand and carrying with you. Gives the information, beats printing everything out, or carrying around a large laptop. Think this will be a great product for parents it is a Christmas gift. The fire tablet is an excellent product. primarily use it to purchase and read books from Kindle. Also, use it for Facebook activity. The battery life is long and it recharges quickly. 10 year old son also enjoys using it. would highly recommend this product to others. husband is a truck driver and being on the road away from home, he likes to have shows and movies to watch. This has so much space for him to download things to watch. have had several budget tablet, but this blows them all away. You have to be willing to be invested in the ecosystem, but it is well worth it. like the portability of it. take it with when babysit granddaughter. Had the previous version of this tablet and was looking to upgrade. Got this on and am very pleased.

HAVE BEEN WITH PRIME FOR 2 YEARS AND THIS NEW FIRE HD MAKES IT WORTH IT. WATCH MOVIES WHEN FLY BECAUSE CAN DOWNLOAD THEM. THE BATTERY LAST FOR DAYS. USE IT EVERYDAY NOW. Reading is easy, can make font as large as you need Not to much to complain about. for less than 100 dollars you get an 8in tablet that has pretty good specs; expandable storage, long battery life, great speakers, fast processor, decent cameras and hi def screen. easy to use and well built tablet....The only knock is the included adds but, after using it for awhile you barely notice it. This is the fastest booting tablet have come across. The speed at which can access sites is really amazing. went into bestbuy to purchase a replacement after died. loved kindle, and decided to get 2in1 with the fire. It is perfect for needs. great product at a great price. like the builtin filter which is easy on youreyes.probably the best reader under 100 dollars. Very good product. Super quality and the store rep explained about the product This is third Kindle Fire and it improves each time. Colors are crisper and best of all it stays charged a lot longer. bought this for sister, who already had the Kindle 7. For the price the 8 is better. First the obvious. a inch more screen does make a difference and the HD makes reading and streaming alot clearer. Being able to add more storage with a micro SD card is a huge plus as well. This device includes a camera! And last at under 100.00 makes this a huge value for a great tablet. Excellent. Just as good as iPad with a fraction of the price. really love the new shape and size of the kindle HD. daughter uses it and can control it great. 'm loving this new fire, mainly because didn't fork out a couple hundred for it. only beef is that magazines are formatted for the demensions of an iPad so don't look great on this Love tablet easy to work and have no problem with down loads.and lite weight. love this Kindle. love the fact that you can use an SD card for more storage. Great job The device is priced just right to give as a gift for an 8 year old have had a hard time with tablets and 8 year old who has been down loading apps since she was around 34 years of age so far this tablet has survived everything except the constant draining of battery when used by her . This tablet is great for anyone who uses this for the basics.Load times can be a bit slow for browsing the web or streaming videos, but once it's loaded, it plays without buffering as long as you got internet speeds that are good enough. This tablet is a good size and great for pictures, downloaded videos and music. For its price, it makes a pretty good gift for someone wanting their first tablet. Bought one for the kids to use while travel, lots of good free games. Installed VLC media player from the app store and filled up the SD drive with movies. Now they are nice and quite for hours on end.Battery life is awesome! Can't beat the value on this. 5 stars even though it has less apps than the play store. had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things. The extra .5 RAM makes a difference. Very happy and if you're a Prime member there are lots of freebies! Does great on browsing and doing research easy to use and love the features especially the private browsing a great price as well Great little tablet for a great price. keep it at work for listening to music or some lunchtime reading. This is a great tablet for teen. She loves it and the price can't be beat! The kindle is great to read on. also like that you can play some games. bought this for wife to replace her 7\" fire that was having a hard time holding a charge anymore. She is thrilled! It was easy for her to transfer all of her books and apps from her old fire to this. She mainly uses this for books , email and some games so this is the perfect tablet for her. better graphics and quicker with the 16gb storage read about this new 8\" tablet in the New York Times. Google Nexus 7, 4 years old, was getting slower and slower, and needed to upgrade  for as little money as possible.This Fire 8\" is an excellent value for the money(only 89!)  very fast, great screen resolution, and easy to use. was skeptical of the Silk browser, which 'd never heard of, but it works fine. There is no \"page forward\" arrow, which is odd, only backwards, but can live with that.It has exceeded expectations and 'm very happy with it. 'm not in the ecosystem, this is first foray, and it's a good one! Congrats to for making an affordable, great quality tablet!Also, the purchasing experience at was easy and convenient, as always! The new Fire HD 8 is an improvement over the Fire HD 7\". It is faster and the larger screen makes reading books much easier. do wish the screen was easier to read when outside or in the car. Too much glare in those places. Love it! 'm not computer savy but was able to figure out most things without any help. Mother needed something since her tablet had died. Was lot easier for her to learn than her old table. She does lots more with Kindle than she did with tablet The new Fire HD 8 tablet is a nice upgrade over the previous version. Storage doubled to 16 GB and the RAM increased by 50 to 1.5 GB. This makes the tablet faster and more responsive. With the improved battery life and much lower price, this is a great general purpose tablet. purchased it for dad (70)He needed something easy to use. He really enjoys it. It a great product..,.

Easier to read and clearer than old one. love this Tablet. It's easy to use, a great price  lightweight. This is second Kindle Fire HD. was satisfied with the first one, but now 'm really enjoying the larger screen. biggest need is to preserve the progress 've made in various games without having to replay them, but at least have access to all books, movies and games. Love the Kindle! Love the product. use it every day for Web,Games and reading. bought this to replace wife's (1st generation) Kindle Fire.

No way to go wrong at this price the new sound and the faster speed plus other improvments are great am very happy with this tablet. purchased it for business purposes, as well as recreational, and it works great for both. did get an SD card for more memory.

Its perfect to see tv series when don't have tv around. It has a very good resolution quality. bought the 8\" to replace old 7\". love the bigger screen got myself 1 of these tablets and so far love the way it works You can enlarge the print and change the lighting to make it easier to read. The only thing with it is you must have an account to use it. bought it as a gift for mother and she loves it love the fire....it works great and the navigation through the Fire is user friendly too. think the 8 is the better buy for your money. BY FAR THE BEST TABLET IVE EVER OWNED, EASY AND QUICK SET UP This tablet is very good especially considering the price. also has memory slot to increase storage. bought this tablet over the holidays when it was on . It has been a great tablet. The battery life is great on these new models. Also playing games everything moves smoothly since it has more ram. The durability of the tablet is great. This thing won't break if you drop it. The only thing don't like is the fire os. You can't get everything you can get on the google store so not all apps are available. have had a few kindle's in the past so this was nothing new for but what loved about this one is that the screen is big so when am reading a book it's a lot easier than when had the first kindle screen. mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing. love it! Great tablet for on the go. Good size screen to watch movies or read book. This tablet was everything was looking for: a cheap tablet that could download Netflix shows for offline viewing Unlike first Kindle, this tablet gives all kinds of information, advertisements and offers when first turn it on. could live without that, but overall, am pleased with this new tablet. It does many things haven't taken the time to explore, but hope to soon. Can't beat the price on this tablet! Great for streaming or casual games. love this so much in home. bought a super tough case and let two and six year old use it. They love watching their movies on it and playing different apps.

Love the price and how easy it is to use. Great buy. This is first kindle. It works great for use. Mostly reading, email, and shopping. Fire HD8 is one of the best deal at 89. Strong, efficient, low price and some features that love. Youtube videos of how to get googleplay and android apps have made things lot more easier. And now, microsoft office is available online for free that can access and edit documents. What else do need? is more respectable brand name than other low price brands or usedold models of high price brands. Definitely recommend it. held off getting a tablet and wish had done it sooner. The Fire 8 is great and easy to use it's wonderful. love it. It's easy to watch movies, play games and read books. love it just like other one just better!!! since already own a kindle knew this was what wanted. Just needed a second one and a little bigger. Always loved the service and help get at BB so knew would purchase it there!! Found sman to be knowledgeable and most helpful. Thanks so much for your help and service It fits just right in your hand. Light weight. Love it extremely happy with purchase. like that the screen is just a little bigger and much faster. Good picture, works well, great variety of apps. keep in mind that you get apps from , not google play, so they aren't always the same or same price This replaced old Kindle Fire. have not yet explored all of the features but, so far, it is performing very well. Tablet is a good size and weight, and easy to use. This tablet has been the best one for the price have purchased 3 other tabs for kids and they have all broke and ran super slow they love them would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save a buck but want quality would recommend this product it is a good tablet to use have had no problems. love Kindle fire. Had a Kindle and it disappeared. Enjoy not having to go to library for books. get a great selection of books every day. For the price the tablet can not be beat. use this over ipads that have. There is nothing cant do with this tablet recently upgraded to this tablet; it is everything wanted. Highly recommend! This is a great tablet for the price! bought it to replace iPad mini. Great for ereading and general browsing. This replaced a Kindle 7 HDX with 32GB of ram. The older tablet had a charging port that wasn't functioning anymore. Had the Geek Squad warranty so they issued a full credit for the old tablet and son chose the HD8 as his new tablet. Other than the screen resolution being lower and less memory, great tablet. son didn't care about the resolution and the new Kindles let you pop in an SD card for more storage. Popped in a 64GB SD card and he's a happy camper now.. ;) purchased this as a gift but have had extensive time with it. It's a great budget tablet, phenomenal screen and a very smooth interface. Handles all apps and HD content well. This was a birthday gift to husband. He really likes it and it does what he needs it to do \"retired\" an earlier version and this new souped up model more than meets needs, and the battery lasts so much longer!! have a kindle and wanted more options. love the bigger screen. find it easy to read. It can have some reflection under lights but not much. Liked this Kindle upgrade. The color screen and backlights allowed for easy night use previous Kindle was dying and wanted a new replacement fast. went to and while they had one it was back ordered a month. Expecting to pay more went to and not only found it for the same price but even better it was available at local store and could pick it up the same day! Easy to use You cant beat it for the price you pay This Kindle is larger than old one and book reading is much easier. Some features don't use so can't comment on them. All in all love it.The only drawback was that the store had no covers that fit this Kindle. Tablet is great and easy to use thankfully because its 1st tablet This is an item that is easy to use for novices. child uses it and has no issues No problems with tablet, kids love it and the size is great Was a present for 14 year old grandson. He was very pleased. For under 100 this 8\" tablet is a bargain. do all want on it like; check email, Facebook, Twitter, watch YouTube, read books, and shop on eBay or . 've been very pleased with purchase. bought it for grand daughter, she knew how to use it right away. You can purchase a rubber case in different colors for protection. This device is great for the price! use it for daughter and after having seeing the ads on , thought this would perfect for her. think that the Kindle tablet was a great purchase for teenage daughter and grandson, very easy to operate. It kept them entertained for hours while were traveling on the train for vacation. Great device. Works very well and use it throughout the day.Keeps informed and great for looking up things and staying in contact. have done this like 5 times now. Don't send this ahs8n. Getting aggravating. Love how am able to run the latest Minecraft on this device, but am not able to on a 3yearold iPad. It seems as apple handy cap their devices. Resolution may not be the best, but for the little buggers it works fine love Fire HD8 got it because Kindle(the original) that husband bought died and the Verizon Tablet wasn't working great for . So came down and the agent at store showed this one, there is a learning curve but it gets better and takes a while to learn but love it. Does all the basic stuff need at a great price. use it for some apps, web browsing and some video. Picked this over the Fire 7\" for the screen size, resolution and CPUGPU. Battery life is pretty good. Ads aren't too annoying.Far cheaper than competing namebrand budget tablets while doing almost everything needed at this level and probably better supported. FireOS will always be a little behind the current Android version and 'd rather have Google Play than , but this still allows for sideloading stuff.Recommend if you're ok with living in 's world andor proficient enough to load other app stores or packages (or know somebody can). Have a nook , this is much better has more apps and thru love the size and the HD quality. Just what was looking for!Downloads apps really fast!

Other two still working great, bf got this as a birthday present from son. It's just like 7\" although larger. cannot tell the different between the regular and the HD and game on it. 'm not sure if it cost more, but wouldn't waste the money if it did. new Kindle is an upgrade from 7 year old Kindle Fire.

This tablet is not only a great price but exactly what needed for quick Internet access and to download books ! purchased the Fire HD 8 to replace 2nd generation Kindle Fire. It works great and the colors are sharp. The 8 is bigger and lighter weight than old 7 and the battery life is longer. It also has more storage and a camera. Love it! lost tablet in Germany and wanted a replacement fast. , had both the 7 and 8 inch Kindle fires in stock, after reading the reviews, decided to go with the 8 inch. Boy was glad that did, the larger viewing area, is great for watching movies and Netflix on the airplane. The 8 inch has stereo sound , unlike the 7 inch which has only mono.

Couldn't be happier. have iPads too which are extremely versatile but they came with a big price but not this tablet. Love it! A very good product by . Considering the price, even better. After using this tablet for a while, have found that even prefer this size over iPad Air. Easy to carry around and long battery life make this preferred device. The screen is just the perfect size for older eyes, the screen on the 7\" fire is just too small and cramped, and it seemed a lot less responsive. highly recommend this sweet tablet. This was a BIRTHDAY GIFT for LITTLE one and she LOVED it! purchased two of these as Christmas presents for children. had been researching child friendly tablets with robust controls to keep them away from undesirable content. found the 7\" Fire Kids Edition, but after looking over the specs and reviews, found myself unsure of it. was mostly interested in the FreeTime application, so did some research on that and found that it was available on other Fire models also. came across the new Fire HD8, which had more power, a better screen, and far better battery life at a very affordable price point. gave them a shot and 'm glad did. have the Fire HD8's locked into FreeTime mode, so the only activities that can be done are ones that approve of, but if want to, can pick up either of them and unlock them to access Netflix Prime or anything else desire. currently have reading goals set up that they must achieve before they are able to access videos or games, and those are limited to X amount of time per day. FreeTime also has a bedtime feature which disablesenables the use of the tablets during designated times, which is amazing.The hardware itself is exceptional. The screen resolution is excellent, it's very responsive, and the battery life is spectacular! They advertise up to 12 hours of battery life, and depending on screen brightness, ours last almost that long regularly. The only con can think of is that the cameras are subpar, but that's not what purchased the tablets for, so it's a nonissue for myself.Some of the reviews read cited that the internal storage was easily filled with FreeTime content, so installed 128GB SD cards in them. also purchased some rugged children's cases for them off of .This is probably one of the best purchases have made in a long time. The sound of silent children reading all day is priceless!!! bought this tablet for sister to replace her kindle. love it except for the fact it would not connect to ATT internet. suspect this was an ATT problem. The internet could not be authenticated. Since have had problems with ATT for seven years, am sure it was a problem with them! Once sis read the instructions, she was good to go! own two fire tablets with this one being the same as owned.. sister in law wanted a tablet and since owned one just like this one figured it to be a good buy.. She just loves it, she is able to do her scheduling, read books and watch her news programs.. It's a great Alertanative to an iPad... great price and just as powerful for a lot less cost.. bought this tablet for son in college and he loves it. Replaced hd fire 7 because broke screed. Very pleased with the large screen. Purchased as a gift. The receiver loves it and said that it works nicely. Purchased this for 80 year old mother in law to replace her old cracked screen one. Everything was perfect easy to use and set up. She has zero problems using this for online and reading books. Love it sent one down to family in Mexico they loved it Bought this as a gift for mother. She absolutely loves it. Easy to set up and use. and the price was right. am loving this tablet. previous tablet was a 1st year Fire. This tablet is great for reading, games,facebook and emails.

Got it for Dad. Easy to use and he loves it. Good stepping stone for future producs One of the best purchases or investments you could make for technology. bought it for kindle books and was amazed by its overall features. Its Kindle with features of a TAB. bought this primarily for reading, but, being a tablet it is able to do so much more! can listen to music, download movies and check email. love it! Way better than Nook! got this tablet for mother and cousins. It's been very speedy to surprise, not as fast as a high end tablet but no lag and a very nice 720p display with good build quality. Would definitely recommend if your looking for an affordable tablet YOU PAY FOR THE BEST AND YOU GET THE BEST. THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING THIS PRODUCT have an older Kindle and enjoyed it very much. However, there is so much more improvement in this tablet with faster processing speed, upgradable storage and longer battery life. 'm really happy! This was the perfect tablet for what husband wanted. 8\" size was not too big or too small. You can carry it without it being clumsy to drop. love kindle.It is user friendly and there's so much more than thought. Awesome tablet and great value for money. son is enjoying it a lot. bought this as a cheap alternative to an old, slow, iPad 2, until could spring for the iPad Pro. Got it as a deal, so it was more than worth it. Was able to add some missing apps that make it even better than thought it could be, and having Prime makes it an inexpensive and handy media device. carry it in bag at all times without having to worry about it's value. Can't beat it for the price. Longtime Apple user, but for this price vs an iPad you can't beat this product! Easy to use. Great picture clarity. Wish they had a cellular version. son needed a tablet to take notes on at college classes. He wanted something small and lightweight instead of taking his laptop. He's found it to work perfectly for what he needs! Love the added space. Easy to move around in. am excited to use all the new features. Gave as Christmas gift,and wife loved it. She has not put it down since she has gotten it. love this new Fire HD. have a 6 year old and 've set it up so that he has his own password and he loves to read all the free books available. The different shades of back lights are cool. If you purchase the new Fire HD, it will enhance your reading experience. had an old Fire and upgraded to the Fire HD. Love everything about it so far. The fire tablet is a great tool for reading, surfing the web, playing games and even watching some Netflix, on a bigger screen, without killing a cell phone charge. Great value! This tablet is great for everything. It's not as powerful as an iPad but the price can't be beat. like that it is a good reader and that you can also put some apps on it  use it to check email, one note, etc. but primarily as a reader. Got this tablet cause wanted to start reading more graphic novels and manga and was very impressed with it it runs smooth and even use Hulu and netflix on it. only flaw with it is that there are ads on your lock screen though you can take them off for 15 other than that it's a grade little tablet! wife wanted this and got it for her. She has been totally happy with it. She loves it for its size for reading online books. The HD8 and HD7 are amazing for the price. They aren't top powered tablets, but they're functional tablets.

Very easy to use from what she tells ! am an avid user for shopping and tablets, bought a different model for younger brother and now purchased this one for grandparents and they love it! purchased this for parents who were always viewing facebook or other videos on their cell phones, this tablet is perfect for them! It's user friendly and if you have an Prime account has great access to movies and music. bought one for 9 year old son for his birthday  and now are buying another one for ten year old. have had some tech issues as are juggling three tablets on one account  but with careful monitoring, it's ok. Wonderful little buy! Tired of bulky tablet. This one stays charged a lot longer! always wanted a tablet and finally decided on the fire 8. It is awesome and love it. downloaded some games and am enjoying them. It is great for internet too. Definitely worth the price. You get a lot for the money. It had lots more options too. It was okay, but most of apps were stripped down versions on the HDFire. It was inexpeisve, but you get what you pay for. The OS is pretyy premitive. The hardware does fell nice. would say it is the perfect device for an older or younger person. have owned several kindles. don't know what do to them, but they tend to die rather quickly. Thank goodness for 's extra protection. The last two that quit on were replaced quickly and effortlessly. Excellent customer service as well!

They seem to have plenty of space and nice to know that can add memory if need to.The tablets hold up to the everyday life of the kids accidental drops kicks and their 3 yr old sister lol. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a new tablet for themselves or children. Will buy again in the future if these ever quick working. Bought it for little grandson he likes games, he can play with it where ever there is wifi. Good tablet and a great price. use it for reading, Netflix and email. Won the kindle fire 6 last xmas2015 at work raffle. Gladly got this kindle fire 8 for a bigger screen and better battery life. Love it. One of the best inexpensive tablets on the market. Great for the casual user Loving this tablet, 5 stars in opinion, definitely worth it. Easy and fun to use. Also, a perfect size even for a man's hand. Bought as a gift and they love it! Great for the price. This is a great reading product. Love the light adjustment in low light areas. can adjust the font sizes for reading comfort and can do other things like download apps or watch movies! really loved 7in. but love 8.5 in. a whole lot.!!!!!!!!!!!!!thanks guys!!! Have not had time to REALLY use it, but hope to download books and games. This is a great, easy to use tablet for the price. Needed a present for mom, at first she didn't use it much cause she had to set it up but now it's great and she loves it. bought it two days before it went on for Christmas and was excellent with price matching Is great for son 8 years old, they help with homework own an ipad,samsug tablets and have both love are fire8's wave better. At first was going to get a iPad but decided to get this instead way cheaper then a iPad and just as good, love it.. Couldn't recommend this more for kids. Price and features are awesome along with parental controls. didn't actually use as bought for a gift. grandson already had one so returned for a pair if 3d goggles. use as a reader and music, games watches movies good all round tablet Just thought were purchasing a capability to download and read books, magazines, etc. But, for such a low price was surprised at the total capabilities available. GOT THE FIRE HD SO KIDS COULD READ BOOKS , PLAY GAMES AND WATCH THEIR SHOWS . WITHOUT SPENDING AN ARM AND A LEG FOR THE TABLET. THINK THIS IS A GOOD TABLE FOR KIDS  YOUNG TEENS WHO WANT TO HAVE A TABLET BUT NOT BREAK THE BANK. bought one for wife and motherinlaw and they both love it. Very easy to use. This was a gift for mother who is 99 years. She used to love puzzles, but with arthritis and failing eyesight she couldn't do them. The puzzle app is good because she can see it and use finger to slide pieces. She can keep up with family on Facebook Very decent tablet. was skeptical at first but it's performance surprised . Battery lasts a decent amount of time and connects beautifully into the ecosystem already am in. Would recommend to anyone who likes to watch videosbrowse the web on the go or for children. was very helpful  the tablet is good for reading books  basic serfing This is a perfect size and weight. Everything is very clear, sharp and large enough to be comfortably readable. Word has it that relationships are interrupted by electronic devices. Well girl takes her reader everywhere go. She used to tell talk to much. Now can hardly get a word in edgewise! This is smaller and lighter than previous fire and works even better It's not a 400.00 tablet so what can you expect, except that it does what it's suppose to. It's faster than thought it would be so thats killer. Everything expected with none of the drawbacks have found in other tablets the only downside of it is that you can't have google playstore on this tablet but you can still install it manually since they both based on android os Great for those who love to read this tablet is always ready for on the go trips only have an older ipad to compare this to, but there is literally no comparison. The Fire 8\" tablet is lightweight, connects ultra fast to wifi, has an easytofollow automatic set up, and comes with tons of features that 'm only beginning to explore. wasn't expecting this at all! 'm a total convert especially because the price is so reasonable, too. This is an upgrade tablet from first Kindle Fire that purchased 5 years ago. Love the larger screen the quick processing and downloads, the great HD visuals, and most importantly all of previous pictures and music files were easily transferredaccessed by this new device. Love that this Fire has a front and rear camer too, old Fire only had a front facing camera. Granted this is not an iPad, but don't want or need all an iPad does. And definitely don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just because it is cool. Fire tablet does everything need or want and it costed under 99.00. am one satisfied and pleased customer. very easy to use live fire the best purchase have made in months Purchased this to get a lighter tablet. Also to update old tablet which had a replaceable battery. This is all around lighter ,thinner and easier to handle. HD is a good upgrade and can't beat the price for comparable tablets with same features. wife reads on it daily and loves it. am probably going to search for another one. have the 8\" and would like to try a 7\" if it were available. like to try different size devices to see how adjust same way with todays phones. The size of the Fire tablet gives you the feel of having a book in your hands while reading a book. Because of the size and lightweight it's easy to transport and fits easily in purse. 'm enjoying Fire tablet which was a gift. The tablet is Excellent! Very fast and well worth the money! The display is great! got this for kid as a gift so he could read books easier and it has helped a ton! got an 8\" windows tablet for father in law and quickly realized that windows is not a good choice for someone that is not already comfortable with all the windows features that are not tablet friendly. This tablet on the other hand, had a very easy learning curve and father in law became comfortable with all the features in a couple of hours. would definitely recommend it as a gift. The 8 inch Fire 6th edition is by the far the best tablet in the market. The 7inch is a nice size, but the 8inch has better screen resolution and longer battery life. If you are an Prime member, this is a must have tablet. Also, the magnetic case does a great job in protection and sleekness. Great tablet for childthis tablet was just everything that need it for child Very easy to use and small enough to travel with. slide it right into bag. would recommend this ereader above all others for its high quality and diversity. Not only as an ereader but as a web browser. love new Kindle Fire even more than old one which lost. Perfect for a kid and it was cheap! son has broke a lot of tablets, this one seems durable. travel a lot and this is perfect for watching movies or reading on the flights The Kindle is great! It's easy to set up and 've found all the books that wanted. Great tab and the price cannot be beat, Only gripe is the fire os. Oh well This tablet is great for the price. It has good connection to wi if. The kindle store is a breeze. The picture quality is good. And seems to be the perfect size. A nice alternative compared to The more expensive tablet. And much better quality then the less expensive tablets would recommend bought two Kindle Fires for 4 year old twin grandsons this past Christmas. downloaded lots of educational programs for them and they absolutely love it! No need to buy them an IPAD which was far more costly! granddaughter love this fire for al her games. also downloaded a music app for her and she is so happy with this. So many things she will learn how to do on this tablet. Bought a Kindle Fire for wife several years ago, son is now 9 and he had kind of taken over the tablet from wife. So decided he was responsible enough and bought this for him for Christmas. cannot believe the improvement over the previous Kindle Fire own. The screen is more clear and bright and even seems more detailed, apps load faster, it connects to the internet faster. For the 89.99 they currently sell for would say it is an excellent value. If you can wait, paid less at Christmas so a lower price could be seen again. This was a great purchase! Love the fact can download TV or movies and watch offline. Easy set up. bought the first edition kindle fire years ago. kids loved it so much that bought this product to replace the old one. They love this one even more. Larger screen and more memory, you can't go wrong! Gift for grandpa so he can do internet searches from his chair and play games. He loved it. It's simple to use and inexpensive love kindle fire it's is good for watching movies reading and anything you need a tablet for. bought this kindle fire for teenage son so he could use it at school and play games on the kindle, he loves it. This tablet is small enough to pack but the screen is the perfect size for watching movies on the plane when traveling. highly recommend kindles. wouldn't own anything else. love reading and this is the best device yet not only for reading. This has wifi capabilities. would highly recommend this item. had Microsoft Surface, unfortunately daughter dropped and cracked screen so needed a new tablet. Since went back to laptop for work didn't need another Surface. Settled on 8\" Kindle HD over Samsung and IPad mini due to value. only use for social networks, email, games, internet search, and occasional viewing of videos. This is a good basic tablet that can handle this no problem with a good wifi connection. Great value as paid under 100 during the holidays and it has been as good as Surface for these basic uses. recently upgraded to this model of Kindle. Liked it so much bought this one for daughter. She loves it. It's much nicer than the older model she and had. had a very early generation Kindle that loved. was unwilling to update Kindle because it was so great. The new one got from wife made it look like the old one was standing still. It's much faster and love it. love this tablet because of its user friendly interface. It reminds of a starter tablet for kids, without being too much of a dull product. Bought this for daughter to use in school, she loves it! Product works great! also bought the older version for mom and she lives it as well would like to say this is best tablet have ever buy till now. will rate it more then iPad Mini. Its best with battery, wifi, touchscreen, sound etc. had other tablet for kids earlier, but after having fire hd8, will not recommend or like to go for any other brand in future. You can't get such good quality product in such less price. am really very happy on right decision to choose fire hd8 for family and kids. Love the access to films. Easy to read and work with. A Little like an Android. am used to IPhone apps but this works great once you understand it. Broke the screen on 2nd gen fire so this is it's replacement. Easy setup, Much faster than older one. Just the right size for games, email, social media. Great and informative service. The guy who helped was very friendly. Love the Fire, the picture is good and really like the link have an LG tablet but picked up this one for Dad and after messing with it for a while it's very nice,. think like it more the LG g pad! really enjoy . It is getting easyer to use and am finding new apps every day. This tablet is awesome...HD resolution, fast processor and affordable! Highly Recommended. Nice tablet. Very speedy. The only thing don't like is that can't add GooglePlay apps to it. At only 69.00 guess that's to be expected. use kindle on a daily basis. It is a good size for reading in bed. son totally loves it! The size is just right, and it is pretty fast. don't have any complaints about it. On Christmas Eve went in looking for an iPad as a gift. They were sold out and was directed to the Fire HD8. The picture quality is amazing (hence the HD). watched a movie on it and the picture was better than HD tv. have to say, would buy this tablet over an iPad any day...AND it cost less than a fourth of the price! Purchased to watch movies. Quality is great. Sound from tablet needs work but earphone is usually used or at least recommended for personal use. The Fire HD8 tablet is a high quality, inexpensive piece of technology that works great for anyone looking to purchase one that won't break the bank. Wasn't happy with first one opened as Christmas gift, it didn't work from right out of the box. Contacted and they sent a new one the next day. This one has worked from the get go. 'm now enjoying new tablet. Very happy with s service and prompt response to the issue. Love Alexa and all of its features. Love that can listen to music and read ebooks Paid 60 for it on during holidays, couldn't ask for better product for the price Bought this for each of grandchildren and they loved it. Very user friendly great tablet well worth the price which was a deal on Original Kindle Fire would finally no longer charge so bought this to replace. Not quite the quality of original (not as fast, resolution not as good) but can't complain for the price. Good choice for casual web surfing and reading. bought this for 3yr old son and it's perfect for him! With a mixture of games (kid friendly) and readalong books makes it a perfect for the kids and of course there's so much more for adults as well.. great buy! Great tablet, especially for the price. bought this to replace an old Fire 7 tablet, that had the battery going down. It works nicely and love the Kindle Freetime and the parental control settings. bought this for niece and she really enjoyed it. She was able to watch Netflix on it and play games. She could surf the internet if she needed to. went with the bigger GB since it wasn't much more. Gave it as a door prize at office party. They love it. This tablet is simple to set up and it's worth the price. It's perfect for beginners. Great tablet for easy operation. Was a great upgrade for a family member. 2nd Fire. Great picture quality. Easy to use. Would recommend for all ages. bought this to take on cruise to read and listen to music... less expensive than tablet, so if loose it not as big a loss... it does all thought it would..easy to set up... to get the most from this tablet you should be an prime member 100 a year, not required,but lots of benefits from it OK its not an iPad, but it is a very good tablet for less than 100 dollars. only complaint is that it don't have a true GPS chip and relies on your WiFi reported location for apps and therefore some apps cannot be loaded on this device that rely on a true GPS. But it is a great travel tablet and with an SD card you can download your or other content and watch offline. A great travel tablet! For the price you get alot of valueGreat for watching movies shopping youtube This product met all of needs and would recommend it to others. have the HD 7 and an HDX 7, and the 8 outperforms them both. If you are an fan of the eco system, this is a must. The screen is bright and crisp. The processor performs very well with the latest software update. love it. Bought to use for recent travel. Was able to download several movies and TV shows from Netflix. Seems to have decent storage. Video playback was fine. Easy to set up and use. Nice graphics and lots of apps to choose. got this for husband who is technology challenged and so far, he's using it without getting frustrated, which is huge! love the first now a new one. everything at your fingertips. purchased for a little guy, and am very pleased with it!! This is actually a pretty good little tablet. It is not the most powerful and it doesn't have the highest resolution screen. But for the price, you can't go wrong. It does what it is supposed to do and for the low price you won't feel much pain if you break it. A perfect first tablet for the kids or a nice secondary tablet that you can just toss in a bag or the car for road trips. Fire tablets are the best products in their price ranges, especially if they are on as they were at the last event. Excellent purchase. This tablet is the best one 've ever bought. And, the least expensive! It satisfies all of needs; email, Facebook, Candy Crush, YouTube, Bluetooth broadcasting to a remote speaker. love it. No frustration whey using the keyboard or finger clicking on icons or commands! was surprised buy how light and compact this was but still strong enough to do what needed. For the price, you can't beat this tablet. It is fast and basic. had problems with White page and was in the process of buying ad new Kindle found this was a better unit for use than tine Whitepage. Perfect for the price. It is great to bring with you on the go. And like said can't beat the price. The only con is it has a plastic back so be careful. The battery is great. would absolutely recommend this product. Gave this to wife for Christmas. Upgraded from the original Kindle. She thoroughly enjoys it. Fire is a good tablet. Portable size . Have bought a couple for gifts as well This tablet is really easy to use and since 'm a Prime member the video's and music is easy to access.

It is a great and affordable tablet for 12  13 year old grandsons. It keeps up with the higher speed internet. So far the tablet works great. got this for daughter for Christmas and she downloads games no problem. The 16gb is great 'm glad purchased the larger storage capacity. like that it gets 12 hours of charge time. Easy to use. bought this on a whim because brother recommended try it sometimes. hard to believe how important this is in life. this has opened up long forgotten youth with music and videos anytime Basic internet plus a ton of apps and some standard ones too. If you want to use it is an excellent tool. Really enjoy this product. Love watching movies and playing games on Fire HD 8 Great rablet, clear screen and small design. Great for watching movies. Great for keeping around the house and doing basic Internet functions. For traveling it lets you bring books, movies andor tv shows via so being Prime is a plus.For you business travelers, out of the box it can open, view,  edit MS Office files, .docx, .xlsx,  .pptx.All this for 25 the price of a iPad. Yes, the iPad can do more, but do you need it? pulled the trigger on the fire tablet knowing the would have to install the google play store separately. with some work this could be the most bang for your buck for an android tablet.

Always a good price and good for what it's meant for. Fire is great for reading Kindle Books, checking email, facebook, or checking out the internet. Haven't ck'd out what else can do with it, but 'm sure there is a lot. Download games, movies, education apps to help ur kids to learn to read do math problems and keep them entertained while on the road or family trips These are excellent to keep on the coffee table or taking along on a trip.

It is fourth kindle and it is best one yet. have had many tablets, Samsung, Asus and old Ipad. This Fire holds its own . The Silk system is not quite as speedy but the lack of bloatware is nice. There is a hack to get more google apps. It's light to hold, the ads are not invasive. enjoy taking advantage of the Prime benefits. Simple to operate. Would recommend for everyday use and moviereading music consumption. Christmas gifts for 2 granddaughters. They loved there first ones. time for a update There are better tablets, but at this price point the Fire HD 8 is outstanding. Reasonably priced and great for the grandkids. purchased cheaper tablets for them last year and none of them lasted! So far these are looking 100 better. This baby is a bargain. Very good screen, decent overall quality and performance...and now Alexa. use it with Bluetooth speaker and it has become office music machine. Hold the home button and ask Alexa to play easy jazz. No muss; no fuss. Improves upon 'regular' Alexa because she has a screen now!. got exactly what was expecting with this purchase, a low cost device for media consumption (ebooks, movies, music) with surprisingly decent performance in the few games 've tried on the device. The MicroSD expansion card slot is a musthave for when purchasing any tablet device. Most people will go with a bigger more sofisticated iPad or Samsung but this is a good product for a child to pass time or someone not wanting all the bells and whistles Perfect cheap device for kids and grandkids nice to have sitting around This Fire HD 8 is first such device. find it to be easy to operate and very responsive.The touch screen control takes getting used to as often click on the wrong close part of the screen and have to go back. The Alexa voice assistant surprised when she announcedherself over the speaker. ( shut her off since 'm not a fan of conversing with computers). main complaint is that comes with nothing but a charger and cable. The wordless, pictorialstart up instructions were primitive and vague. There are no instructions on how to use thisdevice; no sample book to test and get familiar with. There is a help function thatfills in some basics of functionality but not thorough enough. The WiFi connectivity is great, using the latest protocol and encryption. It has a simple web browser but web time also seems to be the greatest drain on the battery. The cable can be used toattach to a Windows PC and transfer files (books, music, pictures etc). would also recommend buying a protective case for if its ever accidently dropped. This Fire tablet is a nice upgrade to the one purchased 3 years ago. The screen is great, it is very fast, has lots of storage with the SD card, and just an allaround good product. And a great value. This tablet is an easy device to download sites and convenient too! Purchased the 8 inch Fire tablet during and have been using it since. A great deal. Doesn't disappoint. Nice features. Owned two prior to this one. Very nice tablet. This is first tablet and 'm excited about learning how to use it. have not used it a ton yet but am very happy with experience so far. This is great for an 8 yr old. She had out grown her Nabi and likes taking pictures this does just the trick. The memory can be extended to hold more pictures. Great tablet. started out with an original kindle and wanted one with backlight and the price was too good to pass up! LOVE fire! subscribe to both Prime and Netflix, and it's perfect for those. Plus you can add additional memory cards. have bought iPads for everyone in house, and bought this for myself and am in heaven. The camera isn't good though, but don't use it. For the money, this is an incredible value. This Kindle fire is amazing. love how kindlely and fiery it is. Great value for such a well made tablet. Everything you need for a low price Loved the Fire HD7 but the latest HD8 is sharper, faster and still handles great. Easy to use tablet. Good price. Great for beginners as well as intermediate users. Fun! Great price and good quality screen image in a nice 8\" format. installed a 128 GB microSD card with no problems. was impressed with the quality of the device and it fit a generic tablet cover that was too big for the 7\" generic tablet had previously purchased. wished had gotten a few more during the .

Add some head phones and that 6 hour trip to Disneyland, well it's so much more tranquil for the adults. The screen is a good size (portable but large enough to read) and has excellent resolution and color quality, the wireless connection is good and the user interface is relatively clear and easy to learn. Bought two of these for grandson and grand daughter and they love them. like the parental controls and the apps. Perfect device for kids. Easy to use with lots of features. had a few other tablets for wife and all were very poor. returned two and landed on this one, she has LOVED it, so much more than the others in this price range. have had two previous kindles since they where first available. really like all the new upgrades. The screen is very crisp and clean. The color is great. Much easier to look for books. This tablet is great! Nice display, and you get the ecosystem. Now you can also download google play easily, so you have the best of both worlds. was unsure about getting a tablet but after purchasing the Fire was convinced that had made the right choice and have been very happy ever since. was concerned that had a lot to learn but it came quickly to and really like the screen size. It was a great buy! For the low price it is very speedy and has sufficient storage space.While it doesn't have Google play, the app store has most of the same apps or a workable alternatve. This is a great tablet!!! absolutely would recommend it to a friend!! would buy it again!! enjoy readi,g and Facebook using this item. also purchased husband one. Brought it for son  Does EXACTLY what want it to do. Bought this as a replacement for the 7\", faster and better display.... Best upgrade have been a Kindle Fire user for years. This new one is amazing. like being able to store information on a SD card. like the battery endurance. The new 8\" screen is great too. am very happy with this tablet. It's a good size for and easy to read and use. was contemplating to buy either the insignia 10.1 or the Fire Hd8, 'm so glad chose the latter. It is so fast and sufficient for needs. also downloaded Google play on the tablet even making this a better purchase. For 59, you can't go wrong with this purchase. Went in to look at the 10' Kindle Fire and couldn't resist the price on this one. There wasn't a big enough size difference to justify spending more than 200.00 for the 10 inch. This has been a great device so far. Battery life, ease of use, etc purchased this for dad as a birthday present. opened it and set it up for him and it works great. It's fast enough for an Internet browser, and possibly a student. have been wanting to purchase a tablet for light web browsing, reading, and to watch videos, something easier to carry than laptop. This tablet is fast  the videos stream in great (as long as you have good WiFi connection). Easy access to too. Bought this for father who would have trouble using a computer. He's picking up on it very quickly. It keeps him entertained. Good reliable device. Got this for 3 year old and 7 year old and they love it. have education apps and books that reads to them or they can read along. would recommend getting a case for it if it's for the little ones just to keep it protected. impulse purchase but a good one. good fit with account that already had. nice screen, easy to navigate This suited exact needs which was a mobile way of watching netflix. thoroughly enjoy this table! Easy to operate, plenty of memory, and can use it for anything that typically use a computer for. Great for airline flights, viewing offline or Netflix shows and reading books. Video quality fine for personal viewing. It has been one of the best purchases ever. It is very simple to use. For this tablet is an extremely good value! iPads are beautiful things, and they seem to just work really well all the time. But they are expensive! Same thing with Android tablets. You can get a cheap Android tablet, but then you're left with a cheap tablet...poor quality displays, questionable hardware, limited support. think hit the spot with their line of Fire Tablets  this HD8 in particular. It's good quality, has a great display, it's quick and snappy, has great battery life. Also being an Android based operating system, there is flexibility like accessing storage, side loading third party apps, even installing Google Play (for those who begrudge the lack of that feature, it can be done). Much more flexibility than you get with an Apple product, at a much lower price than the industry standard Samsung etc. Coming from using Apple products for so long, this thing is really convincing that there are really viable options other than Apple, and especially for the price, its a great introduction to a different platform. Not only that, it's genuinely a good product! The tablet works great so far. The parent features are nice also. gave this Fire HD8 as a retirement gift for friend and she absolutely loves it!! Bought it for daughter and she loves it great product at a great price! Easy, fast and efficient.great lil tablet in this price range for anyone. This is a great tablet for the price. have one that purchased a few years ago and use it much more than laptop. Recently purchased two more for gifts. Does the job when travel and would recommend to a friend This is fifth Kindle and with each new one have a new feature to use. Perfect tablet for 8 year old without spending a fortune. love how it has parental controls so can limit his time playing. Used for reading and surfing the web, this tablet is great for all. Great screen clarity. Purchased the tablet because it was a very reasonable price. It has ended up being a good tablet. bought this for mom because she is too scared to even use her laptop. thought this looked more user friendly since she knows 5 year old nephew can use an iPad. purchased several of these tablets during the holidays as gifts. Everyone absolutely loves the FireHD8, especially those with the prime memberships. only regret is not purchasing one for myself. It's easy to use and son likes to play on it alot bought this for 86 year old father. he loves it. finds it very easy to use perfect gift perfect price for wife to bring her into the technilogical modern world live in like it!! Would buy again.Still learning about it's features. Good value Bought it for 89 year old mom. She has enjoyed reading on it. Easy to use needed to upgrade from the orginal Kindle fire and this Fire works great. Videos,games, email and battery life all are great. Works as expected. enjoy reading newspaper articles, books, as well as banking apps and social media tools. installed a driver for google play store; also payed to get rid of the lock screen ads (15). It was worth it. use this thing alot. Easy to use, great battery life, plenty of space and amazing screen quality. Excellent product. The screen is very easy to read and can access movies, books, and ,more. Was given as a gift to mother and she loves it. wife reads a ton, she uses it everyday. She's owned others and this is by far the best. This tablet is hands down the best investment 've ever made. used to carry a laptop to meetings, then kids talked into getting a tablet and what a difference.

These are very good for the price with two flaws: The screen is good and much better than other Android devices at 7\" but not great, and got the 8 Mb version with would not recommend in hindsight. Because Android's subpar management on SD cards, got these this year. It has a much better screen, not only larger but with better resolution, adequate speakers for its price, it's fast enough and overall more enjoyable to use. 16 Gb is the minimum 'd recommend, even with SD cards because some apps just work better with internal storage, and some apps even stored in SD will still use some amount of internal storage.It also has Alexa voice support.The main reason for these tablets in case is the Freetime subscription that has unlimited access to thousands of ageappropriate books, hundreds (or thousand) of free apps and heavily curved web access per age presets. Fire OS has a decent support for multiuser and in particular kids accounts. kids are 7 and 9. They spend a lot of time on games as expected but also read a good amount of books. wife loves her new Fire 8 tablet. It is easy to use and rubs quickly and smoothly,. It is a very nice tablet, but the 10 inch tablet seems faster and easier to enjoy for the price Really wanted a tablet that was near the nexus 7, but didn't have too much bulk! looked at the Nvidia Shield as well, and ended up settling on the Fire HD.

However was so impressed with its features, performance, and ease of use, that 've added a 128 gb MicroSD card so can download videos for grand kids to watch while are on the road.

Easy to navigate, color is beautiful A great tablet for not a lot of money. Does what the more expensive tablets does for less. Was looking at some more expensive Android tablets to replace a 3year old device and saw this one on . Despite the relatively much lower price, was originally very worried that the app ecosystem was going to be sorely lacking compared to the full Google Play catalog. But it turns out that while it is missing some important apps (not just games but productivity apps too), the more than adequate specs (good enough screen, 1.5 GB of RAM, decent processor) are enough for 95 of what need from a tablet. And if you can get it on , you can't go wrong. Lastly, if you're deciding between the 7\" and this 8\" Fire, splurge a little bit and get this one instead. Fire HD8 is great for browsing and reading. GPS system not that great though. was not told had to belong to . Could not get it to work with Router. had been wanting this Tablet for some time and finally decided to purchase it. am heart sick to have to return it. At one time working with the a general Manager by the name of Brenda on problems, she was highly disrespectful , embarrassing to front of other customers and very rude. Representing to the people who actually pay her salary and taking all into account, would fire her in a heart beat. understand from other employees she is like this quite often. If you can't fire her maybe taking her off the floor where she has to deal with the public and putting her behind the scenes would benefit more than you know. 01162017. Thank you. This is the best thing for reading specially on the go. Now want one. older son wants one to. Keep of the good work. It's good budget tablet for someone who wants to use light apps, video streaming, and internet.1.5gb ram is enough for most apps.16g memory and sd card slot gives enough space.

            "This product so far has not disappointed. children love to use it and like the ability to monitor control what content they see with ease. great for beginner or experienced person. Bought as a gift and she loves it Inexpensive tablet for him to use and learn on, step up from the NABI. He was thrilled with it, learn how to Skype on it already... bought this for grand daughter when she comes over to visit. set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price think this tablet is best one out there. You can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost. This fire 8 inch tablet is the perfect size. purchased it for husband so that he has a bigger screen than just his phone. He had gotten one a few years ago so knew it would be a good purchase. gave this as a Christmas gift to inlaws, husband and uncle. They loved it and how easy they are to use with fantastic features! Great as a device to read books. like that it links with borrowed library ebooks. Switched from another popular tablet brand and am happy with the choice made. It took some time to get books from previous nonKindle reader, but finally figured out a way! Excellent product. Easy to use, large screen makes watching movies and reading easier. Got it as a present and love the size of the screen The kindle is easiest to use, graphics and screen crisp, clear, brilliant colors. Great video quality lots of fun apps fun for the whole family Love love love kindle fire 8.....this is what 9 yr old granddaughter said when bought this for her at Christmas.. have purchased kindled in the past but this one has been the best....love the fact that you can now use a memory card in it...that helps so much when you use it for books...games...music and viedos...thanks Excellent tablet with nice screen. wish would pre install the play store, this would have been perfect. Preloaded with the reading app from Kindle but expandable with other apps. Perfect for travel. Carry your library, games and productivity apps in a small footprint. Very happy with this product and easy to use..picture is clear, takes great pictures.. grandchildren are home schooled and utilize the tables for many learning apps! They LOVE using them as it makes them feel \"so grown up\"! The tablets are a great leaning tool and they are receiving many benefits from them! Great size, easy to carry for traveling. Need to spend more time Looking into apps for contact manegement, interactive calenders and most important, music storage and use. was surprised when learned of the capabilities of this device. Now husband has more access to his desktop and am doing things which couldn't on his device. The visual quality on the Fire 8 HD is amazing. It runs very fast and is easy to use, very durable. This is a great tablet for the price, would recommend it to anyone looking for a basic tablet. am still learning all the things can do with new Kindle Fire. It is so much better (lighter in weight and easier to use) than old tablet. Just the right size for reading books and playing some games. love everything about this tablet! The imaging is sharp and clear. It's fast and light weight. Love it! This is exactly what the person wanted as a gift and she enjoys using it. It's fast and easy to use. This is second kindle fire . For the money you cannot beat this tablet. Full of features, picture quality is great, and very fast speed while using the internet. Easy to use, solid build, sharp HP screen for movies. Who needs more? this is first tablet .. love it .. actually read first ebook on it .. large screen, easy to read  play games .. fits nicely in purse Sleek packaging easy set up and great for anyone who wants a e reader with more to offer. Best and most affordable option of all the Kindle devices available. did not want to get a new kindle but old one would not charge or show a charge anymore. could not depend on it for any length of time so finally broke down and bought a new one. am very happy with this one. was afraid would lose music and photos since not all came from the store. However, everything had on the old kindle transferred to the new one. am still learning all about it but so far so good. Excellent tablet to leave at easel and display reference photos. It's light enough to velcro to a articulating stand (so can position the tablet right next to canvas). It's cheap enough to not worry about. love it, for the price. bought this wanting for books comics and movies and it has not disappoint ever since 4 year old Grandson loves his Kindle. He had to have one after his sister got one. Easy to use. As a beginner found this pad very good. Enjoy the kindle app. Purchased this for daughter to do more reading. It has so much more options for her if she wants. this is a great tablet for the price. kid loves it ,does alot reading on it. believe that this will be very useful during husbands recovery from foot surgery. This is a wonderful device. love the extra capabilities and apps. am very happy with this tablet. The worst thing is that steals it all the time. Lol A family member has vision problems. They had seenused the Kindle of another family member  especially the ability to scale text. This device will make it possible to read, which she has had extreme difficulty doing. Easy setup and connect to WIFI. Great viewing area. Easy to read in bright places. got this fire for friend who wants to buy kindle..this serves both Kindle and Tab... very nice and very cheap..worth for what paid.. highly recommend this for beginners Amazing tablet with fast processor. It looks great... got good deal got this for 5 year old and this is really great for the price. Works like a charm!! find it easy to use, but the kindle does not come with instructions, so you have to find your way around. love this tablet. The battery life last a long time. use Kindle Fire predominately for watching movies on Prime, Netflix's, and checking emails. also carry it to appointments and meetings. It is a compact tablet, and not big and bulky. The playback of the movies are great, and the movies are HD. Great little tablet if you are looking for something to watch movies and checking emails. would definitely recommend this tablet to friends and family members. daughter loves this kindle, she does so much with it,well worth the money. Was looking for a tablet that was highly portable  could run DIRECTTV app  stream videos. (Other electronics have are much older versions). sman recommended this model to based on personal experience. am still learning all its functions but so far it seems easy to use  is doing what it promised to do. This is second Fire, the other one is now retired. like having HD. Works just fine. wife bought this for for birthday. enjoy reading biographys which usually have color photos. The regular Kindle make the pics black and white or they're aren't any. This allows to see the color photos. also love the night feature when 'm in bed reading. no longer need a light on to read or need to hold a large book. Thanks to a knowledgeable, lowpressure sperson, was ready to buy first tablet. This one was the right price (on ) and have not been disappointed. Every few days learn more ways to use it besides checking emails  checking out library books  audio books. It stays charged for days, even with regular use. recommend it as an inexpensive and very satisfactory alternative to more expensive tablets. It's a great tablet for the price. Don't expect it to be as fast more expensive ones. It's meant for casual use and it does a great job at that. For the price, you can't beat it. Get a nice large microsd card and you don't have to worry about space. It runs a little slow on certain things if you are multitasking but it's a simple tablet. 've run plenty of 720p videos without fail. It's great for ebooks or other files. Some more elaborate pdfs take a while to load if they have a lol of graphics. Battery life seems good for a small table too.The only real Issue have is the App store being limited. It is an offshoot of Android but not all the same apps are available. There is a way around it but wish they would just allow it access to Google Play or at least offer the same apps.So, it's a nice inexpensive table that works great. For the money, you will love it but don't get upset that is doesn't run as fast as a 500 tablet. That's not its job. Very easy to use tablet. Lots of apps and game available. love the FreeTime settings for kids on the newer Kindle Fires. was able to create a login for each of kids as well as myself and set limits to the amount of device time they are allowed daily (can set to more for weekends if desired). You can set the age restrictions for content also, to avoid inappropriate ads, etc. Once you've downloaded apps, you can choose which ones you want each child to have access to in their profile settings, so if one child is older you can allow them access to something their younger siblings shouldn't have. Basically, like that can set their access rights and know they're safe so don't have to continually monitor every moment. By the way, FreeTime kids settings are available without having to subscribe to their FreeTime app access plan. :) Purchased as a door prize gift given with a one year membership. The recipient loves it and says it performs very well. (As a past Fire user, now Pad graduate, loved Fire for more than 4 years without any problems.

Has many educational apps would definitely go into the settings if you're a mother like who Is a very strict of what your children watch on TV or what games and apps they download would definitely recommend setting the parental controls before giving it to them.

This Fire's clarity is much improved over old one, plus it responds better. don't like that can't choose a photo for the locked screen  that it HAS to be an advertisement. also don't like that it usually takes a few trys to unlock.

He said he doesn't use the computer, but he was on smartphone daily viewing FB. got him a drone for Christmas and he needed something to view, while it is flying. researched the Kindle Fire and thought he could practice with it until spring. He farms, so isn't busy in the winter. Thank goodness, because he is busy with his Kindle for hours every day. He thinks it is great and do too, because now have phone back. really enjoy reading. So much so was running out of shelf space. have read a few books with pad mini but it really didn't do the trick. No so with new Fire Hd8. Handy sized, not the least bit heavy and super bright. Add in the face that digital material from magazines to novels are often as not far cheaper that \"hard copies\".

Amongst the others felt this was a deal Smartphone works on the job for , but with the Fire can read instructions and worksheets. It is a useful tool for connecting with both friends and colleagues. 8inches is the right size for holding in hand and carrying with you.

Colors are crisper and best of all it stays charged a lot longer. bought this for sister, who already had the Kindle 7. For the price the 8 is better. First the obvious. a inch more screen does make a difference and the HD makes reading and streaming alot clearer. Being able to add more storage with a micro SD card is a huge plus as well. This device includes a camera! And last at under 100.00 makes this a huge value for a great tablet. Excellent. Just as good as iPad with a fraction of the price. really love the new shape and size of the kindle HD. daughter uses it and can control it great. 'm loving this new fire, mainly because didn't fork out a couple hundred for it. only beef is that magazines are formatted for the demensions of an iPad so don't look great on this Love tablet easy to work and have no problem with down loads.and lite weight. love this Kindle. love the fact that you can use an SD card for more storage. Great job The device is priced just right to give as a gift for an 8 year old have had a hard time with tablets and 8 year old who has been down loading apps since she was around 34 years of age so far this tablet has survived everything except the constant draining of battery when used by her . This tablet is great for anyone who uses this for the basics.Load times can be a bit slow for browsing the web or streaming videos, but once it's loaded, it plays without buffering as long as you got internet speeds that are good enough. This tablet is a good size and great for pictures, downloaded videos and music. For its price, it makes a pretty good gift for someone wanting their first tablet. Bought one for the kids to use while travel, lots of good free games. Installed VLC media player from the app store and filled up the SD drive with movies. Now they are nice and quite for hours on end.Battery life is awesome! Can't beat the value on this. 5 stars even though it has less apps than the play store. had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things. The extra .5 RAM makes a difference. Very happy and if you're a Prime member there are lots of freebies! Does great on browsing and doing research easy to use and love the features especially the private browsing a great price as well Great little tablet for a great price. keep it at work for listening to music or some lunchtime reading.

It was easy for her to transfer all of her books and apps from her old fire to this. She mainly uses this for books , email and some games so this is the perfect tablet for her. better graphics and quicker with the 16gb storage read about this new 8\" tablet in the New York Times. Google Nexus 7, 4 years old, was getting slower and slower, and needed to upgrade  for as little money as possible.This Fire 8\" is an excellent value for the money(only 89!)  very fast, great screen resolution, and easy to use. was skeptical of the Silk browser, which 'd never heard of, but it works fine. There is no \"page forward\" arrow, which is odd, only backwards, but can live with that.It has exceeded expectations and 'm very happy with it. 'm not in the ecosystem, this is first foray, and it's a good one! Congrats to for making an affordable, great quality tablet!Also, the purchasing experience at was easy and convenient, as always! The new Fire HD 8 is an improvement over the Fire HD 7\". It is faster and the larger screen makes reading books much easier. do wish the screen was easier to read when outside or in the car. Too much glare in those places. Love it! 'm not computer savy but was able to figure out most things without any help. Mother needed something since her tablet had died. Was lot easier for her to learn than her old table. She does lots more with Kindle than she did with tablet The new Fire HD 8 tablet is a nice upgrade over the previous version. Storage doubled to 16 GB and the RAM increased by 50 to 1.5 GB. This makes the tablet faster and more responsive.

Easier to read and clearer than old one. love this Tablet. It's easy to use, a great price  lightweight. This is second Kindle Fire HD. was satisfied with the first one, but now 'm really enjoying the larger screen. biggest need is to preserve the progress 've made in various games without having to replay them, but at least have access to all books, movies and games.

This is an awesome tablet, fast, great display and has all the apps need for personal entertainment If you look for a great tablet for entertainment this is the best you can have, if you want a tablet for working applications this is not the one so be aware and buy this tablet if you want tons of entertainment. also it have a larger processor and internal memory and the external memory to keep all your photos is unbelievable strongly recommend it, again, not for work but for entertainment. bought 2, 1 for each kid.

It has a very good resolution quality. bought the 8\" to replace old 7\". love the bigger screen got myself 1 of these tablets and so far love the way it works You can enlarge the print and change the lighting to make it easier to read.

BY FAR THE BEST TABLET IVE EVER OWNED, EASY AND QUICK SET UP This tablet is very good especially considering the price. also has memory slot to increase storage. bought this tablet over the holidays when it was on . It has been a great tablet. The battery life is great on these new models. Also playing games everything moves smoothly since it has more ram. The durability of the tablet is great. This thing won't break if you drop it. The only thing don't like is the fire os. You can't get everything you can get on the google store so not all apps are available. have had a few kindle's in the past so this was nothing new for but what loved about this one is that the screen is big so when am reading a book it's a lot easier than when had the first kindle screen. mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing. love it! Great tablet for on the go. Good size screen to watch movies or read book. This tablet was everything was looking for: a cheap tablet that could download Netflix shows for offline viewing Unlike first Kindle, this tablet gives all kinds of information, advertisements and offers when first turn it on. could live without that, but overall, am pleased with this new tablet.

Love the price and how easy it is to use. Great buy. This is first kindle. It works great for use. Mostly reading, email, and shopping. Fire HD8 is one of the best deal at 89. Strong, efficient, low price and some features that love. Youtube videos of how to get googleplay and android apps have made things lot more easier. And now, microsoft office is available online for free that can access and edit documents. What else do need? is more respectable brand name than other low price brands or usedold models of high price brands. Definitely recommend it. held off getting a tablet and wish had done it sooner. The Fire 8 is great and easy to use it's wonderful. love it. It's easy to watch movies, play games and read books. love it just like other one just better!!! since already own a kindle knew this was what wanted. Just needed a second one and a little bigger.

Tablet is a good size and weight, and easy to use. This tablet has been the best one for the price have purchased 3 other tabs for kids and they have all broke and ran super slow they love them would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save a buck but want quality would recommend this product it is a good tablet to use have had no problems. love Kindle fire. Had a Kindle and it disappeared. Enjoy not having to go to library for books. get a great selection of books every day. For the price the tablet can not be beat. use this over ipads that have. There is nothing cant do with this tablet recently upgraded to this tablet; it is everything wanted. Highly recommend! This is a great tablet for the price! bought it to replace iPad mini. Great for ereading and general browsing. This replaced a Kindle 7 HDX with 32GB of ram. The older tablet had a charging port that wasn't functioning anymore. Had the Geek Squad warranty so they issued a full credit for the old tablet and son chose the HD8 as his new tablet. Other than the screen resolution being lower and less memory, great tablet. son didn't care about the resolution and the new Kindles let you pop in an SD card for more storage. Popped in a 64GB SD card and he's a happy camper now.. ;) purchased this as a gift but have had extensive time with it. It's a great budget tablet, phenomenal screen and a very smooth interface. Handles all apps and HD content well. This was a birthday gift to husband. He really likes it and it does what he needs it to do \"retired\" an earlier version and this new souped up model more than meets needs, and the battery lasts so much longer!! have a kindle and wanted more options. love the bigger screen. find it easy to read. It can have some reflection under lights but not much. Liked this Kindle upgrade. The color screen and backlights allowed for easy night use previous Kindle was dying and wanted a new replacement fast. went to and while they had one it was back ordered a month. Expecting to pay more went to and not only found it for the same price but even better it was available at local store and could pick it up the same day! Easy to use You cant beat it for the price you pay This Kindle is larger than old one and book reading is much easier. Some features don't use so can't comment on them. All in all love it.The only drawback was that the store had no covers that fit this Kindle. Tablet is great and easy to use thankfully because its 1st tablet This is an item that is easy to use for novices. child uses it and has no issues No problems with tablet, kids love it and the size is great Was a present for 14 year old grandson. He was very pleased. For under 100 this 8\" tablet is a bargain. do all want on it like; check email, Facebook, Twitter, watch YouTube, read books, and shop on eBay or . 've been very pleased with purchase. bought it for grand daughter, she knew how to use it right away. You can purchase a rubber case in different colors for protection. This device is great for the price! use it for daughter and after having seeing the ads on , thought this would perfect for her. think that the Kindle tablet was a great purchase for teenage daughter and grandson, very easy to operate. It kept them entertained for hours while were traveling on the train for vacation. Great device. Works very well and use it throughout the day.Keeps informed and great for looking up things and staying in contact. have done this like 5 times now. Don't send this ahs8n. Getting aggravating. Love how am able to run the latest Minecraft on this device, but am not able to on a 3yearold iPad. It seems as apple handy cap their devices. Resolution may not be the best, but for the little buggers it works fine love Fire HD8 got it because Kindle(the original) that husband bought died and the Verizon Tablet wasn't working great for . So came down and the agent at store showed this one, there is a learning curve but it gets better and takes a while to learn but love it. Does all the basic stuff need at a great price. use it for some apps, web browsing and some video. Picked this over the Fire 7\" for the screen size, resolution and CPUGPU. Battery life is pretty good. Ads aren't too annoying.Far cheaper than competing namebrand budget tablets while doing almost everything needed at this level and probably better supported. FireOS will always be a little behind the current Android version and 'd rather have Google Play than , but this still allows for sideloading stuff.Recommend if you're ok with living in 's world andor proficient enough to load other app stores or packages (or know somebody can). Have a nook , this is much better has more apps and thru love the size and the HD quality. Just what was looking for!Downloads apps really fast! Never thought a tablet at this price could be this good. Totally recommended! This is sixth unit and has features many of the newer models didn't have. love the apps that are on here and everything else think it's the perfect tablet for a beginner has all of the apps that you will need Love this tablet. 16GB memory but have expansion slot.

He has low vision problems and this made reading his favorite books a lot easier to read. Very good tablet for the price economical and the ability to carry in backpack bought this Kindle for husband's birthday. have had a Kindle since 2013 and used it mostly to read and check emails while travelling. husband is not particularly a book reader, but he spends way too many hours alone, in his office, reading his face book messages. Now, with the new Kindle he actually multitasks, in the living room, on facebook, email, and internet, at least in proximity to , so he might even join in a conversation! think his Kindle has much imporoved 35 year marriage!

Up and coming new technology helps everyone to enjoy life more greatly This is the perfect tablet for purposes. Easy to use and the perfect size. Not too large and not too small. This device is s really good piece of electronic. It is a good reader and also is very good for 2 year old granddaughter to use. For son as a present for college books. 5 textbooks were 14 the price on kindle than if bought them on , this is third kindle. Other two still working great, bf got this as a birthday present from son. It's just like 7\" although larger. cannot tell the different between the regular and the HD and game on it. 'm not sure if it cost more, but wouldn't waste the money if it did. new Kindle is an upgrade from 7 year old Kindle Fire. As to be expected the video quality is better along with faster performance and more features. still use old Kindle as it is still ticking but the \"shiny new toy\" is fun. can play games, surf the internet or watch movies. can check email or just about do anything can do on a regular computer. strongly recommend it. This is a terrific tablet at a great price. The quality is excellent, the price is right, it has tons of storage capacity. And oh, did mention that it's cheap? (Cheap for a tablet, that is.) bought the HD Fire 7 for wife, liked hers decided to buy the Fire HD 8 for myself love it.Nice graphics easy to use. have used the Kindle mostly for reading. have downloaded books from , some free some purchased, that have heard about for years and now will read. have also read Manga from the Internet. use of the internet has also included looking up gardening hints, animal care, and dog breed characteristics. This was a gift for son and he loves it. It not only helps him with his homework but he could also play games on it! This tablet is not only a great price but exactly what needed for quick Internet access and to download books ! purchased the Fire HD 8 to replace 2nd generation Kindle Fire. It works great and the colors are sharp. The 8 is bigger and lighter weight than old 7 and the battery life is longer. It also has more storage and a camera. Love it! lost tablet in Germany and wanted a replacement fast. , had both the 7 and 8 inch Kindle fires in stock, after reading the reviews, decided to go with the 8 inch. Boy was glad that did, the larger viewing area, is great for watching movies and Netflix on the airplane. The 8 inch has stereo sound , unlike the 7 inch which has only mono. Overall am really happy with this tablet Pros  HD quality for low price. Works really well with account to access multiple features with extreme ease. Couldn't be happier. have iPads too which are extremely versatile but they came with a big price but not this tablet. Love it! A very good product by . Considering the price, even better. After using this tablet for a while, have found that even prefer this size over iPad Air. Easy to carry around and long battery life make this preferred device. The screen is just the perfect size for older eyes, the screen on the 7\" fire is just too small and cramped, and it seemed a lot less responsive. highly recommend this sweet tablet. This was a BIRTHDAY GIFT for LITTLE one and she LOVED it! purchased two of these as Christmas presents for children. had been researching child friendly tablets with robust controls to keep them away from undesirable content. found the 7\" Fire Kids Edition, but after looking over the specs and reviews, found myself unsure of it. was mostly interested in the FreeTime application, so did some research on that and found that it was available on other Fire models also. came across the new Fire HD8, which had more power, a better screen, and far better battery life at a very affordable price point. gave them a shot and 'm glad did. have the Fire HD8's locked into FreeTime mode, so the only activities that can be done are ones that approve of, but if want to, can pick up either of them and unlock them to access Netflix Prime or anything else desire. currently have reading goals set up that they must achieve before they are able to access videos or games, and those are limited to X amount of time per day. FreeTime also has a bedtime feature which disablesenables the use of the tablets during designated times, which is amazing.The hardware itself is exceptional. The screen resolution is excellent, it's very responsive, and the battery life is spectacular! They advertise up to 12 hours of battery life, and depending on screen brightness, ours last almost that long regularly. The only con can think of is that the cameras are subpar, but that's not what purchased the tablets for, so it's a nonissue for myself.Some of the reviews read cited that the internal storage was easily filled with FreeTime content, so installed 128GB SD cards in them. also purchased some rugged children's cases for them off of .This is probably one of the best purchases have made in a long time. The sound of silent children reading all day is priceless!!! bought this tablet for sister to replace her kindle. love it except for the fact it would not connect to ATT internet. suspect this was an ATT problem. The internet could not be authenticated. Since have had problems with ATT for seven years, am sure it was a problem with them! Once sis read the instructions, she was good to go! own two fire tablets with this one being the same as owned.. sister in law wanted a tablet and since owned one just like this one figured it to be a good buy.. She just loves it, she is able to do her scheduling, read books and watch her news programs.. It's a great Alertanative to an iPad... great price and just as powerful for a lot less cost.. bought this tablet for son in college and he loves it. Replaced hd fire 7 because broke screed. Very pleased with the large screen. Purchased as a gift. The receiver loves it and said that it works nicely. Purchased this for 80 year old mother in law to replace her old cracked screen one. Everything was perfect easy to use and set up. She has zero problems using this for online and reading books. Love it sent one down to family in Mexico they loved it Bought this as a gift for mother. She absolutely loves it. Easy to set up and use. and the price was right. am loving this tablet. previous tablet was a 1st year Fire. This tablet is great for reading, games,facebook and emails. This is third Kindle and have loved them all. still have first Kindle and use it. just wore Kindle Fire out with 5  years use. am very happy with everything new one can do. No disappointments at all. Got it for Dad. Easy to use and he loves it. Good stepping stone for future producs One of the best purchases or investments you could make for technology. bought it for kindle books and was amazed by its overall features. Its Kindle with features of a TAB. bought this primarily for reading, but, being a tablet it is able to do so much more! can listen to music, download movies and check email. love it! Way better than Nook! got this tablet for mother and cousins. It's been very speedy to surprise, not as fast as a high end tablet but no lag and a very nice 720p display with good build quality. Would definitely recommend if your looking for an affordable tablet YOU PAY FOR THE BEST AND YOU GET THE BEST. THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING THIS PRODUCT have an older Kindle and enjoyed it very much. However, there is so much more improvement in this tablet with faster processing speed, upgradable storage and longer battery life. 'm really happy! This was the perfect tablet for what husband wanted. 8\" size was not too big or too small. You can carry it without it being clumsy to drop. love kindle.It is user friendly and there's so much more than thought. Awesome tablet and great value for money. son is enjoying it a lot. bought this as a cheap alternative to an old, slow, iPad 2, until could spring for the iPad Pro. Got it as a deal, so it was more than worth it. Was able to add some missing apps that make it even better than thought it could be, and having Prime makes it an inexpensive and handy media device. carry it in bag at all times without having to worry about it's value. Can't beat it for the price. Longtime Apple user, but for this price vs an iPad you can't beat this product! Easy to use. Great picture clarity. Wish they had a cellular version. son needed a tablet to take notes on at college classes. He wanted something small and lightweight instead of taking his laptop. He's found it to work perfectly for what he needs! Love the added space. Easy to move around in. am excited to use all the new features. Gave as Christmas gift,and wife loved it. She has not put it down since she has gotten it. love this new Fire HD. have a 6 year old and 've set it up so that he has his own password and he loves to read all the free books available. The different shades of back lights are cool. If you purchase the new Fire HD, it will enhance your reading experience. had an old Fire and upgraded to the Fire HD. Love everything about it so far. The fire tablet is a great tool for reading, surfing the web, playing games and even watching some Netflix, on a bigger screen, without killing a cell phone charge. Great value! This tablet is great for everything. It's not as powerful as an iPad but the price can't be beat. like that it is a good reader and that you can also put some apps on it  use it to check email, one note, etc. but primarily as a reader. Got this tablet cause wanted to start reading more graphic novels and manga and was very impressed with it it runs smooth and even use Hulu and netflix on it. only flaw with it is that there are ads on your lock screen though you can take them off for 15 other than that it's a grade little tablet! wife wanted this and got it for her. She has been totally happy with it. She loves it for its size for reading online books. The HD8 and HD7 are amazing for the price. They aren't top powered tablets, but they're functional tablets. Right now, in Feb 2017, either one is a good replacement for the Nexus 7. Bought this for niece and she loves it. Very easy to use from what she tells ! am an avid user for shopping and tablets, bought a different model for younger brother and now purchased this one for grandparents and they love it! purchased this for parents who were always viewing facebook or other videos on their cell phones, this tablet is perfect for them! It's user friendly and if you have an Prime account has great access to movies and music. bought one for 9 year old son for his birthday  and now are buying another one for ten year old. have had some tech issues as are juggling three tablets on one account  but with careful monitoring, it's ok. Wonderful little buy! Tired of bulky tablet. This one stays charged a lot longer! always wanted a tablet and finally decided on the fire 8. It is awesome and love it. downloaded some games and am enjoying them. It is great for internet too. Definitely worth the price. You get a lot for the money. It had lots more options too. It was okay, but most of apps were stripped down versions on the HDFire. It was inexpeisve, but you get what you pay for. The OS is pretyy premitive. The hardware does fell nice. would say it is the perfect device for an older or younger person. have owned several kindles. don't know what do to them, but they tend to die rather quickly. Thank goodness for 's extra protection. The last two that quit on were replaced quickly and effortlessly. Excellent customer service as well! Love using this Kindle to look up real estate s, play mind games, and take pictures. Love the bigger screen and the great resolution. Sound is also far superior to older model Lindle. Wife loves it. She said it opens much faster and likes auto updates for apps. This Tablet does absolutely everything want! can watch TV Shows or Movies, check Mail, Facebook, Google.......pay all bills. It processes fast and has a beautiful screen. As said: Everything want in a Tablet for less than 100! And she has been happy about it ever since.

After a slow start getting her going (she is not tech savvy) she is really enjoying the versatility of this tablet. Although it does not have cellular data ability, which she had no use for, it gives her the flexibility to connect to wireless networks when she makes her weekly casino visits. serves all needs in a economy tablet and would reccomend it to all.

The fire tablet 2016 is quite good. It provides sufficient content  ability to do all of the basics one requires in a tablet. The 8 inch screen is bright and provides various settings. The tablet's light weight makes it very portable. Need to buy a tablet for Mother as a Christmas gift. Functionality is great and she uses it for all her online needs The Fire HD 8 is the perfect size EReader. Big enough to see the text but small enough to hold comfortably. bought this Fire HD8 as a Christmas present for wife. It is the second tablet have given to her over the past 5 years. She LOVES it!

Very versatile and fast loading times. Definitely recommend. Can't say enough about the Kindle Fire. It literally is fiiiiiiyah... fast, easy to use, and an allaround perfect tablet. Recommend keeping an eye out for special pricing at holidays to save some cheddar, but otherwise 'd say pick this little black rectangle of portable interwebz awesomeness up the first chance you get. The best product for the money. East to use, great color, great features. easy to set up and battery life is great. bought this one for 40 during the , as a gift to cousin. He was flattered by the performance, even didn't expect it to be this good! It works flawlessly with the usual games and apps, what you are going to miss the most is YouTube, 's app store does not have youtube. Other than that it meets all requirements for daily use. Best B It is helping them to learn to read and follow directions . had the products and provided great customer service. Grandsons are enjoying product use. This tablet exceeds its reviews. its easy to use and the screen is great. husband and purchased the new Kindle Fire HD 8 tablets for 16 yr old son and 12 yr old daughter for Christmas. have an older version 7 in myself so already knew were buying a durable tablet. The new ones are awesome and they had them in colors so very easy to distinguish who's is whom purchased during and got them for 30 off, which was an amazing discount and made love it even more. had shopped around many places prior to and. They are light weight and the screen is plenty big enough for them to watch movies, play games, do homework and video calls friends and family out of town. They seem to have plenty of space and nice to know that can add memory if need to.The tablets hold up to the everyday life of the kids accidental drops kicks and their 3 yr old sister lol. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a new tablet for themselves or children. Will buy again in the future if these ever quick working.

At first was going to get a iPad but decided to get this instead way cheaper then a iPad and just as good, love it.. Couldn't recommend this more for kids. Price and features are awesome along with parental controls. didn't actually use as bought for a gift. grandson already had one so returned for a pair if 3d goggles. use as a reader and music, games watches movies good all round tablet Just thought were purchasing a capability to download and read books, magazines, etc. But, for such a low price was surprised at the total capabilities available. GOT THE FIRE HD SO KIDS COULD READ BOOKS , PLAY GAMES AND WATCH THEIR SHOWS . WITHOUT SPENDING AN ARM AND A LEG FOR THE TABLET. THINK THIS IS A GOOD TABLE FOR KIDS  YOUNG TEENS WHO WANT TO HAVE A TABLET BUT NOT BREAK THE BANK. bought one for wife and motherinlaw and they both love it. Very easy to use. This was a gift for mother who is 99 years. She used to love puzzles, but with arthritis and failing eyesight she couldn't do them. The puzzle app is good because she can see it and use finger to slide pieces. She can keep up with family on Facebook Very decent tablet. was skeptical at first but it's performance surprised . Battery lasts a decent amount of time and connects beautifully into the ecosystem already am in. Would recommend to anyone who likes to watch videosbrowse the web on the go or for children. was very helpful  the tablet is good for reading books  basic serfing This is a perfect size and weight. Everything is very clear, sharp and large enough to be comfortably readable. Word has it that relationships are interrupted by electronic devices. Well girl takes her reader everywhere go. She used to tell talk to much. Now can hardly get a word in edgewise! This is smaller and lighter than previous fire and works even better It's not a 400.00 tablet so what can you expect, except that it does what it's suppose to. It's faster than thought it would be so thats killer. Everything expected with none of the drawbacks have found in other tablets the only downside of it is that you can't have google playstore on this tablet but you can still install it manually since they both based on android os Great for those who love to read this tablet is always ready for on the go trips only have an older ipad to compare this to, but there is literally no comparison. The Fire 8\" tablet is lightweight, connects ultra fast to wifi, has an easytofollow automatic set up, and comes with tons of features that 'm only beginning to explore. wasn't expecting this at all! 'm a total convert especially because the price is so reasonable, too. This is an upgrade tablet from first Kindle Fire that purchased 5 years ago. Love the larger screen the quick processing and downloads, the great HD visuals, and most importantly all of previous pictures and music files were easily transferredaccessed by this new device. Love that this Fire has a front and rear camer too, old Fire only had a front facing camera. Granted this is not an iPad, but don't want or need all an iPad does. And definitely don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just because it is cool. Fire tablet does everything need or want and it costed under 99.00. am one satisfied and pleased customer. very easy to use live fire the best purchase have made in months Purchased this to get a lighter tablet. Also to update old tablet which had a replaceable battery. This is all around lighter ,thinner and easier to handle. HD is a good upgrade and can't beat the price for comparable tablets with same features. wife reads on it daily and loves it. am probably going to search for another one. have the 8\" and would like to try a 7\" if it were available. like to try different size devices to see how adjust same way with todays phones. The size of the Fire tablet gives you the feel of having a book in your hands while reading a book. Because of the size and lightweight it's easy to transport and fits easily in purse. 'm enjoying Fire tablet which was a gift. The tablet is Excellent! Very fast and well worth the money! The display is great! got this for kid as a gift so he could read books easier and it has helped a ton! got an 8\" windows tablet for father in law and quickly realized that windows is not a good choice for someone that is not already comfortable with all the windows features that are not tablet friendly. This tablet on the other hand, had a very easy learning curve and father in law became comfortable with all the features in a couple of hours. would definitely recommend it as a gift. The 8 inch Fire 6th edition is by the far the best tablet in the market. The 7inch is a nice size, but the 8inch has better screen resolution and longer battery life. If you are an Prime member, this is a must have tablet. Also, the magnetic case does a great job in protection and sleekness. Great tablet for childthis tablet was just everything that need it for child Very easy to use and small enough to travel with. slide it right into bag. would recommend this ereader above all others for its high quality and diversity. Not only as an ereader but as a web browser. love new Kindle Fire even more than old one which lost. Perfect for a kid and it was cheap! son has broke a lot of tablets, this one seems durable. travel a lot and this is perfect for watching movies or reading on the flights The Kindle is great! It's easy to set up and 've found all the books that wanted. Great tab and the price cannot be beat, Only gripe is the fire os. Oh well This tablet is great for the price. It has good connection to wi if. The kindle store is a breeze. The picture quality is good. And seems to be the perfect size. A nice alternative compared to The more expensive tablet. And much better quality then the less expensive tablets would recommend bought two Kindle Fires for 4 year old twin grandsons this past Christmas. downloaded lots of educational programs for them and they absolutely love it! No need to buy them an IPAD which was far more costly! granddaughter love this fire for al her games. also downloaded a music app for her and she is so happy with this. So many things she will learn how to do on this tablet. Bought a Kindle Fire for wife several years ago, son is now 9 and he had kind of taken over the tablet from wife. So decided he was responsible enough and bought this for him for Christmas. cannot believe the improvement over the previous Kindle Fire own. The screen is more clear and bright and even seems more detailed, apps load faster, it connects to the internet faster. For the 89.99 they currently sell for would say it is an excellent value. If you can wait, paid less at Christmas so a lower price could be seen again. This was a great purchase! Love the fact can download TV or movies and watch offline. Easy set up. bought the first edition kindle fire years ago. kids loved it so much that bought this product to replace the old one. They love this one even more. Larger screen and more memory, you can't go wrong! Gift for grandpa so he can do internet searches from his chair and play games. He loved it. It's simple to use and inexpensive love kindle fire it's is good for watching movies reading and anything you need a tablet for. bought this kindle fire for teenage son so he could use it at school and play games on the kindle, he loves it. This tablet is small enough to pack but the screen is the perfect size for watching movies on the plane when traveling. highly recommend kindles. wouldn't own anything else. love reading and this is the best device yet not only for reading. This has wifi capabilities. would highly recommend this item. had Microsoft Surface, unfortunately daughter dropped and cracked screen so needed a new tablet. Since went back to laptop for work didn't need another Surface. Settled on 8\" Kindle HD over Samsung and IPad mini due to value. only use for social networks, email, games, internet search, and occasional viewing of videos. This is a good basic tablet that can handle this no problem with a good wifi connection. Great value as paid under 100 during the holidays and it has been as good as Surface for these basic uses. recently upgraded to this model of Kindle. Liked it so much bought this one for daughter. She loves it. It's much nicer than the older model she and had. had a very early generation Kindle that loved. was unwilling to update Kindle because it was so great. The new one got from wife made it look like the old one was standing still. It's much faster and love it. love this tablet because of its user friendly interface. It reminds of a starter tablet for kids, without being too much of a dull product. Bought this for daughter to use in school, she loves it! Product works great! also bought the older version for mom and she lives it as well would like to say this is best tablet have ever buy till now. will rate it more then iPad Mini. Its best with battery, wifi, touchscreen, sound etc. had other tablet for kids earlier, but after having fire hd8, will not recommend or like to go for any other brand in future. You can't get such good quality product in such less price. am really very happy on right decision to choose fire hd8 for family and kids. Love the access to films. Easy to read and work with. A Little like an Android. am used to IPhone apps but this works great once you understand it. Broke the screen on 2nd gen fire so this is it's replacement. Easy setup, Much faster than older one. Just the right size for games, email, social media. Great and informative service. The guy who helped was very friendly. Love the Fire, the picture is good and really like the link have an LG tablet but picked up this one for Dad and after messing with it for a while it's very nice,. think like it more the LG g pad! really enjoy . It is getting easyer to use and am finding new apps every day. This tablet is awesome...HD resolution, fast processor and affordable! Highly Recommended. Nice tablet. Very speedy. The only thing don't like is that can't add GooglePlay apps to it. At only 69.00 guess that's to be expected. use kindle on a daily basis. It is a good size for reading in bed. son totally loves it! The size is just right, and it is pretty fast. don't have any complaints about it. On Christmas Eve went in looking for an iPad as a gift. They were sold out and was directed to the Fire HD8. The picture quality is amazing (hence the HD). watched a movie on it and the picture was better than HD tv. have to say, would buy this tablet over an iPad any day...AND it cost less than a fourth of the price! Purchased to watch movies. Quality is great. Sound from tablet needs work but earphone is usually used or at least recommended for personal use. The Fire HD8 tablet is a high quality, inexpensive piece of technology that works great for anyone looking to purchase one that won't break the bank. Wasn't happy with first one opened as Christmas gift, it didn't work from right out of the box. Contacted and they sent a new one the next day. This one has worked from the get go. 'm now enjoying new tablet. Very happy with s service and prompt response to the issue. Love Alexa and all of its features. Love that can listen to music and read ebooks Paid 60 for it on during holidays, couldn't ask for better product for the price Bought this for each of grandchildren and they loved it. Very user friendly great tablet well worth the price which was a deal on Original Kindle Fire would finally no longer charge so bought this to replace. Not quite the quality of original (not as fast, resolution not as good) but can't complain for the price.

The WiFi works great and is ready to access and use. Don't buy this unit if you want cell (4g) access to the Internet. It is WiFi only.

Always a good price and good for what it's meant for. Fire is great for reading Kindle Books, checking email, facebook, or checking out the internet. Haven't ck'd out what else can do with it, but 'm sure there is a lot. Download games, movies, education apps to help ur kids to learn to read do math problems and keep them entertained while on the road or family trips These are excellent to keep on the coffee table or taking along on a trip.

There is a hack to get more google apps. It's light to hold, the ads are not invasive. enjoy taking advantage of the Prime benefits. Simple to operate. Would recommend for everyday use and moviereading music consumption. Christmas gifts for 2 granddaughters. They loved there first ones. time for a update There are better tablets, but at this price point the Fire HD 8 is outstanding. Reasonably priced and great for the grandkids. purchased cheaper tablets for them last year and none of them lasted! So far these are looking 100 better. This baby is a bargain. Very good screen, decent overall quality and performance...and now Alexa. use it with Bluetooth speaker and it has become office music machine. Hold the home button and ask Alexa to play easy jazz. No muss; no fuss. Improves upon 'regular' Alexa because she has a screen now!. got exactly what was expecting with this purchase, a low cost device for media consumption (ebooks, movies, music) with surprisingly decent performance in the few games 've tried on the device. The MicroSD expansion card slot is a musthave for when purchasing any tablet device. Most people will go with a bigger more sofisticated iPad or Samsung but this is a good product for a child to pass time or someone not wanting all the bells and whistles Perfect cheap device for kids and grandkids nice to have sitting around This Fire HD 8 is first such device. find it to be easy to operate and very responsive.The touch screen control takes getting used to as often click on the wrong close part of the screen and have to go back. The Alexa voice assistant surprised when she announcedherself over the speaker. ( shut her off since 'm not a fan of conversing with computers). main complaint is that comes with nothing but a charger and cable. The wordless, pictorialstart up instructions were primitive and vague. There are no instructions on how to use thisdevice; no sample book to test and get familiar with. There is a help function thatfills in some basics of functionality but not thorough enough. The WiFi connectivity is great, using the latest protocol and encryption. It has a simple web browser but web time also seems to be the greatest drain on the battery. The cable can be used toattach to a Windows PC and transfer files (books, music, pictures etc). would also recommend buying a protective case for if its ever accidently dropped. This Fire tablet is a nice upgrade to the one purchased 3 years ago. The screen is great, it is very fast, has lots of storage with the SD card, and just an allaround good product. And a great value. This tablet is an easy device to download sites and convenient too! Purchased the 8 inch Fire tablet during and have been using it since. A great deal. Doesn't disappoint. Nice features. Owned two prior to this one. Very nice tablet. This is first tablet and 'm excited about learning how to use it. have not used it a ton yet but am very happy with experience so far. This is great for an 8 yr old. She had out grown her Nabi and likes taking pictures this does just the trick. The memory can be extended to hold more pictures. Great tablet. started out with an original kindle and wanted one with backlight and the price was too good to pass up! LOVE fire! subscribe to both Prime and Netflix, and it's perfect for those. Plus you can add additional memory cards. have bought iPads for everyone in house, and bought this for myself and am in heaven. The camera isn't good though, but don't use it. For the money, this is an incredible value. This Kindle fire is amazing. love how kindlely and fiery it is. Great value for such a well made tablet. Everything you need for a low price Loved the Fire HD7 but the latest HD8 is sharper, faster and still handles great. Easy to use tablet. Good price. Great for beginners as well as intermediate users. Fun! Great price and good quality screen image in a nice 8\" format. installed a 128 GB microSD card with no problems. was impressed with the quality of the device and it fit a generic tablet cover that was too big for the 7\" generic tablet had previously purchased. wished had gotten a few more during the .

The fact that it was on onethird off on made the final choice easy. are very pleased with how this product works and how it met needs for a bit larger screen. Easy for midseventy yearolds to use.

Bought two of these for grandson and grand daughter and they love them. like the parental controls and the apps. Perfect device for kids.

This is a great tablet!!! absolutely would recommend it to a friend!! would buy it again!! enjoy readi,g and Facebook using this item. also purchased husband one. Brought it for son  Does EXACTLY what want it to do. Bought this as a replacement for the 7\", faster and better display.... Best upgrade have been a Kindle Fire user for years. This new one is amazing. like being able to store information on a SD card. like the battery endurance. The new 8\" screen is great too. am very happy with this tablet. It's a good size for and easy to read and use. was contemplating to buy either the insignia 10.1 or the Fire Hd8, 'm so glad chose the latter. It is so fast and sufficient for needs. also downloaded Google play on the tablet even making this a better purchase. For 59, you can't go wrong with this purchase. Went in to look at the 10' Kindle Fire and couldn't resist the price on this one. There wasn't a big enough size difference to justify spending more than 200.00 for the 10 inch. This has been a great device so far. Battery life, ease of use, etc purchased this for dad as a birthday present. opened it and set it up for him and it works great. It's fast enough for an Internet browser, and possibly a student. have been wanting to purchase a tablet for light web browsing, reading, and to watch videos, something easier to carry than laptop. This tablet is fast  the videos stream in great (as long as you have good WiFi connection). Easy access to too. Bought this for father who would have trouble using a computer. He's picking up on it very quickly. It keeps him entertained. Good reliable device.

Easy to operate, plenty of memory, and can use it for anything that typically use a computer for. Great for airline flights, viewing offline or Netflix shows and reading books. Video quality fine for personal viewing. It has been one of the best purchases ever. It is very simple to use. For this tablet is an extremely good value! iPads are beautiful things, and they seem to just work really well all the time. But they are expensive! Same thing with Android tablets. You can get a cheap Android tablet, but then you're left with a cheap tablet...poor quality displays, questionable hardware, limited support. think hit the spot with their line of Fire Tablets  this HD8 in particular. It's good quality, has a great display, it's quick and snappy, has great battery life. Also being an Android based operating system, there is flexibility like accessing storage, side loading third party apps, even installing Google Play (for those who begrudge the lack of that feature, it can be done). Much more flexibility than you get with an Apple product, at a much lower price than the industry standard Samsung etc. Coming from using Apple products for so long, this thing is really convincing that there are really viable options other than Apple, and especially for the price, its a great introduction to a different platform. Not only that, it's genuinely a good product! The tablet works great so far. The parent features are nice also. gave this Fire HD8 as a retirement gift for friend and she absolutely loves it!! Bought it for daughter and she loves it great product at a great price! Easy, fast and efficient.great lil tablet in this price range for anyone. This is a great tablet for the price. have one that purchased a few years ago and use it much more than laptop. Recently purchased two more for gifts. Does the job when travel and would recommend to a friend This is fifth Kindle and with each new one have a new feature to use. Perfect tablet for 8 year old without spending a fortune. love how it has parental controls so can limit his time playing. Used for reading and surfing the web, this tablet is great for all. Great screen clarity. Purchased the tablet because it was a very reasonable price. It has ended up being a good tablet. bought this for mom because she is too scared to even use her laptop. thought this looked more user friendly since she knows 5 year old nephew can use an iPad. purchased several of these tablets during the holidays as gifts. Everyone absolutely loves the FireHD8, especially those with the prime memberships. only regret is not purchasing one for myself. It's easy to use and son likes to play on it alot bought this for 86 year old father. he loves it. finds it very easy to use perfect gift perfect price for wife to bring her into the technilogical modern world live in like it!!

These are very good for the price with two flaws: The screen is good and much better than other Android devices at 7\" but not great, and got the 8 Mb version with would not recommend in hindsight. Because Android's subpar management on SD cards, got these this year. It has a much better screen, not only larger but with better resolution, adequate speakers for its price, it's fast enough and overall more enjoyable to use. 16 Gb is the minimum 'd recommend, even with SD cards because some apps just work better with internal storage, and some apps even stored in SD will still use some amount of internal storage.It also has Alexa voice support.The main reason for these tablets in case is the Freetime subscription that has unlimited access to thousands of ageappropriate books, hundreds (or thousand) of free apps and heavily curved web access per age presets. Fire OS has a decent support for multiuser and in particular kids accounts. kids are 7 and 9. They spend a lot of time on games as expected but also read a good amount of books. wife loves her new Fire 8 tablet. It is easy to use and rubs quickly and smoothly,.

Easy to navigate, color is beautiful A great tablet for not a lot of money. Does what the more expensive tablets does for less. Was looking at some more expensive Android tablets to replace a 3year old device and saw this one on . Despite the relatively much lower price, was originally very worried that the app ecosystem was going to be sorely lacking compared to the full Google Play catalog. But it turns out that while it is missing some important apps (not just games but productivity apps too), the more than adequate specs (good enough screen, 1.5 GB of RAM, decent processor) are enough for 95 of what need from a tablet. And if you can get it on , you can't go wrong. Lastly, if you're deciding between the 7\" and this 8\" Fire, splurge a little bit and get this one instead. Fire HD8 is great for browsing and reading. GPS system not that great though. was not told had to belong to . Could not get it to work with Router. had been wanting this Tablet for some time and finally decided to purchase it. am heart sick to have to return it. At one time working with the a general Manager by the name of Brenda on problems, she was highly disrespectful , embarrassing to front of other customers and very rude. Representing to the people who actually pay her salary and taking all into account, would fire her in a heart beat. understand from other employees she is like this quite often. If you can't fire her maybe taking her off the floor where she has to deal with the public and putting her behind the scenes would benefit more than you know. 01162017. Thank you. This is the best thing for reading specially on the go. Now want one. older son wants one to. Keep of the good work.
