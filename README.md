# 🧠 Robot Adviser — NLP-Powered Product Review Website

**Turning noisy customer feedback into clear buying decisions.**

Robot Adviser is an **end-to-end NLP system** that classifies product reviews, clusters products into meaningful groups, and generates human-like product recommendation articles using **state-of-the-art LLMs**.

This repository contains the full workflow:  
data preprocessing → model training → evaluation → deployment.

## 🚀 Project Goals

This project aims to **automate product review analysis** using modern NLP:

1. **Sentiment Classification**  
   Classify customer reviews into **positive, neutral, or negative** sentiment to help businesses understand customer satisfaction.

2. **Product Clustering**  
   Group products into **4–6 meta-categories** using unsupervised learning, enabling easier category insights and recommendation grouping.

3. **AI-Generated Product Summaries (LLMs)**  
   Use extractive + abstractive **Generative AI models** to summarize thousands of reviews into:
   - buyer-friendly articles  
   - top product recommendations per category  

   ✨ *Only LLMs were used for summarization — no classical techniques.*

## 🔍 1. Sentiment Classification (Model 1)

**Goal:** predict whether a review is *positive*, *neutral*, or *negative*.

### Techniques Used
- TF-IDF vectorization  
- Support Vector Machine (LinearSVC)  
- Class imbalance strategies (class weights)  
- **LLM-based noise removal:**  
  - Detect mismatches between *text sentiment vs star rating*  
  - Remove rows caused by **errors or sarcasm**

### Results  
- **F1 Macro:** 0.71  
- **F1 Weighted:** 0.97  
- Noise reduced from **67k → 60k reviews**

---

## 📦 2. Product Clustering (Model 2)

**Goal:** group products into **4–6** meaningful categories.

### Pipeline  
- Text cleaning and preprocessing  
- TF-IDF vectorization  
- K-Means clustering  
- k-selection using:
  - Elbow method  
  - Silhouette score  

### Results  
- Final clusters: **6 meta-categories**  
- Evaluation metrics:  
  - Silhouette: **0.283** (fair)  
  - Davies-Bouldin: **1.71**  
  - Balanced cluster sizes

## ✨ 3. Review Summarization (Model 3)

**Goal:** transform thousands of reviews into **clear, useful product recommendations**.

### Two-step LLM pipeline
1. **Extractive Summary**  
   - Model: `distilbert-base-nli-mean-tokens` (SBERT)

2. **Abstractive Summary**  
   - Model: `facebook/bart-large-cnn`  
   - + LoRA optimization for faster fine-tuning

### Evaluation
- **ROUGE-1:** 0.34  
- **ROUGE-2:** 0.09  
- **BERTScore F1:** 0.88–0.89

## 🌐 Deployment

The models were integrated into a **Streamlit demo website** that enables users to:
- Upload datasets  
- View sentiment distribution  
- Explore meta-clusters  
- Generate summaries and final product recommendation articles
